				Welcome to the Mafia Forum! Please read the <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=534&amp;t=490304" class="bbcode_url">Mafia FAQ</a> before signing up for a game. Thanks!<br>
<br>
To join a Regular or Mini Mafia Game, please wait for the sign ups of such a game to open. Generally, the moderator of that game will make a post announcing their game with instructions regarding how to join. There is no Regular/Mini Queue; you'll have to watch the thread for updates on upcoming games.<br>
<br>
To join a Newbie Mafia Game as a Newbie, join the Newbie Queue. Please post "<b>/join</b>" if you are a Newbie (see FAQ above). Before each Newbie Mafia Game, the top nine or so people on the queue, with 1st timers and others in an approximate 2:1 ratio, will be PM'd. If you would like to remain on the queue (though you were too late for the game, or otherwise cannot play in this game but would like to play in a future one), <b>respond to this PM</b>. In addition, the first six responders within 48 hours will be able to participate in the game. This process will be repeated, going down the list until the six Newbie participants have been selected. <b>If you receive such a PM on two separate occasions and do not respond to either of them, your name will be removed from the Newbie Queue.</b><br>
<u><b>Please do not sign up again if you are already on the queue, or your original queue position will be forfeited in place of the later position.</b></u><br>
<br>
To join a Newbie Mafia game as an SE or IC, make sure your name is on the Active SEs/ICs list at the bottom of this post. If your name is on the list, you will be collectively notified by PM whenever a Newbie game is available to join. If your name is not on the list, please PM summitwei to get your name added.<br>
<br>
(PSA: Make sure you have receiving PM's turned on, if you want to play. Otherwise, we can't PM you to ask you if you want to join a game.)<br>

				This thread is where moderators post to notify others that they need a replacement for a player in their games. Players can either respond when a moderator posts here, or can sign up for replacing before a moderator requests.<br>
<br>
You can replace in any game in which you have had no prior involvement. This obviously means you should not have played (if it is absolutely necessary, mods may ask players to replace who died early and were the equivalent of a vanilla [flavorless] townie), and you should not know about the setup or anything like that aside from what is posted in the thread.

				Being filled with information.<br>
<br>
In the <i>City</i>, all was well. The villagers lived peacefully with their police officers strolling around to ensure that no one suspicious was walking around. All were oblivious of the underground threat just waiting for the right moment, the right time to strike. As it happened, that time... was now.<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia, a psychological game focused on the outcome of a scenario where the informed minority (mafia) is pitted against the oblivious majority (town).<br>
<br>
The goal of the town is to eliminate the mafia using any means possible to assure the safety of their civilians.<br>
The goal of the mafia is to slowly eliminate town members until the mafia can outnumber the town.<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Gameplay (and Roles)</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Mafia is played as a game of stages. There are two main stages in Mafia:<br>
<br>
<b>Day</b><br>
Daytime is a time when everyone comes out and discuss with each other about who they think is the mafia. As discussion goes by, people can place a vote on who they suspect is the mafia. If that person is voted to a majority of the players, then that player is hanged and dies. The moderator will then reveal the player's role and alignment (town or scum). After that, the players go back to their beds and night begins.<br>
<br>
<b>Night</b><br>
Nighttime is the time for the mafia to premiere from their houses. They leave from secret passageways from their houses to get to a pre-destined meeting spot. There, they discuss on a player that they want to kill. Then, they issue a whisper to the mod, who kills the targeted player. Then, the mafia go back to their houses and pretend to sleep. Day then begins.<br>
<br>
Other than Day and Night, there is also a small sub-stage known as Twilight, which is simply the time between a majority of votes is reached and when the mod posts the hang post. This isn't really a phase, but you are still permitted to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
In a "normal" game of Mafia, there would be a set number of citizens and a set number of mafia members, or mafia goons. However, that's boring. Therefore:<br>
<b><u>The Roles</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>Vanilla Townie</b>: The Vanilla Townie is a classical role, and is simply a citizen of the City. He/She does not have any special powers other than his/her vote, which he/she can use to suggest who appears to be suspicious. Town-Aligned<br>
<br>
<b>Cop</b>: The Cop is another common role, and is a police officer of the City. He/She is given a flashlight, which he/she can use to inspect one person a night. The cop will then be given a result of "Innocent" or "Guilty". (Innocent refers to a Town-Aligned role and Guilty refers to a Mafia-Aligned role) Town-Aligned<br>
<br>
<b>Doctor</b>: The Doctor is another common role, and is a doctor in the City. He/She is given a medkit, which he/she can use to protect one person a night. That night, if the protected player is targeted by the mafia, the doctor will be able to heal him so that he won't die. Town-Aligned<br>
<br>
<b>Mafia Goon</b>: The Mafia Goon is a common Mafia role. He/She is a simple goon in the mafia and does not have any special powers. Every night, the mafia comes together and targets one player to kill. Mafia-Aligned<br>
<br>
<u>Some Other Common Roles</u><br>
[list][*]Roleblocker: Can target one player each night who cannot perform a night action during that night. Town<br>
[*]Vigilante: Can kill one person each night. Town<br>
[*]Jailkeeper: A player who can target one player each night who will be protected, but will not be able to perform a role that night. Town<br>
[*]Mafia Rolecop: A player who can target one player each night, who will receive the player's role. Mafia<br>
[*]Mafia Roleblocker: Can target one player each night who cannot perform a night action during that night. Mafia[/list]<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">More Roles</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b><u>Town</u></b><br>
[list][*]Watcher: Can target one player in the night, and will receive a report of who targeted that player during the night.<br>
[*]Tracker: Can target one player in the night, and will receive a report of who the player targeted during the night.<br>
[*]Mason: A group of Town-Aligned people who are confirmed town to each other and can talk to each other in the night.<br>
[list][*]Recruiting Mason: A mason member who can choose one person to appoint into the mason each night. If that player is Town-Aligned, then the player is appointed. If that player is Mafia-Aligned, the Recruiting Mason is killed.[/list]<br>
[*]Role Cop: A cop who receives the role of the targeted player.<br>
[*]Bodyguard: A player who can protect one player from being killed each night, but if the protected player is targeted by the Mafia, the Bodyguard dies.<br>
[*]Vengeful: A vengeful is a townie in every way except if hanged, he can immediately kill one player.<br>
[*]SINP Cops: Cops of Differing Sanity. If you are a Cop, which Sanity you are might not be disclosed.<br>
[list][*]Sane Cop: A normal cop. Will receive honest results.<br>
[*]Insane Cop: An insane cop will have opposite results. Town will look "Guilty" and Mafia will look "Innocent"<br>
[*]Naive Cop: Always receives a result of "Innocent"<br>
[*]Paranoid Cop: Always receives a result of "Guilty"[/list][/list]<br>
<br>
<b><u>Mafia</u></b><br>
[list][*]Mafia Godfather: A Mafia leader. If inspected by a Cop, the result will be "Innocent".[/list]<br>
<br>
<b><u>Third-Party</u></b><br>
Sometimes, there will be other third-parties:<br>
<br>
<b>Serial Killer</b>: One-person scum. One kill every night. Wins if everyone else is dead.<br>
<br>
<b>Cult</b>: A separate kind of scum faction. Can talk during the night. Does not have a night kill.<br>
[list][*]Cult Recruiter: Can recruit one person every night to the Cult. If recruited is Town, the person is turned into a Cult Member. If recruited is Mafia, Cult Recruiter dies.<br>
[*]Cult Member: A town-aligned player who was recruited to the Cult. Wins if Cult overpowers all.[/list]<br>
<br>
<b>Survivor</b>: Wins if he/she is alive by the endgame.<br>

<i>BM</i> - Short for "Bastard Mod", who can lie to players (including in role pm), uses a relatively screwed up setup where players might change roles, alliances, and sometimes with messed up, new roles. Generally not good for a newb game.<br>
<i>Breadcrumbing</i> - A post which hides certain clues in a very subtle manner<br>
<i>Cult</i> - A third-party mafia with no night kill.<br>
<i>EBWON</i> - Edit by way of Ninja'd - when you click "Submit" and someone beat you to posting, which requires you to change your post<br>

<i>FoS</i> - Finger of Suspicion<br>

<i>IC</i> - Inexperience Challenged, basically an experienced player chosen by the community or the mods to help newbies learn the game.<br>

<i>LAL</i> - Hang all Liars<br>

<i>LYLO</i> - Hang or Lose, state where you must keep hanging mafia to win (one misstep = lose)<br>

<i>Newb</i> - Contrast to Noob. Someone who is a new player to Mafia. (Derived from the word "newbie")<br>
<i>Newb Card</i> - When a new player uses the excuse of simply being a newbie when a mistake is made. The alternate form is "Noob Card" and uses the fact that they are a noob, but this is much less believable.<br>
<i>NK</i> - Abbreviation for Night Kill.<br>
<i>Noob</i> - Contrast to Newb. Someone who acts like a new player to Mafia.<br>
<i>OMGUS</i> - OMG You Suck, I'm gonna vote you because you voted me. (Used in joking fashion)<br>

<i>SK</i> - Serial Killer<br>
<i>V/LA</i> - Vacation/Limited Access. Scourge and destroyer of game activity, if you know you will be V/LA during a game, preferably don't join to play, and DON'T MOD! Seriously, this causes game abandoning.<br>
<i>VI</i> - village idiot, a person who consistently acts contrary to town interests as if he has no idea what he's doing<br>
<i>Vig</i> - Short for Vigilante. It is a role that is a town-aligned nightkiller.<br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Joining a Game</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">To join a mafia newbie game, navigate yourself to the <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=534&amp;t=490400" class="bbcode_url">Mafia Players Sign-ups</a> and join the queue by typing "/join newbie queue" or "/join newbie". A mod will then come and add you to the queue.<br>
<br>
To join a mini/large game, it's suggested you play through a newbie first. In case you want to join a mini/large right away, just type "/join mg##", where ## is the number of the Mafia Game you want to join. A mod will add you to the queue.</div><br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Modding a Game</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Modding a game is slightly more difficult than playing one. To help the players and you, all game mods must be approved by a forum mod to run a game.<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Long Process (by willwang123)</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Step 1: Decide that you want to mod and sign up in the Mafia Moderators thread. Be sure to also indicate which type of game you wish to mod (newbie, mini, or large). You will be added to the respective queue. This will put your game at Level 0 of 5.<br>
.     Note: To mod a mini, you must be an SE, IC, or have 1 co-mod or modding experience. To mod a large or a newbie game, you must have 1 modding experience.<br>
Step 2: Create your game, which should include roles, role distribution, and flavor (optional). This will put your game at Level 3 of 5.<br>
Step 3: Once you have your setup complete, post on the Moderator thread that you need a reviewer for your setup. Once someone reviews your setup for balance, your game is at Level 4 of 5.<br>
Step 4: It is strongly suggested that you begin drafting/writing Role PMs and your first mod post. Once your setup is finalized and all ready to go, you are at Level 5 of 5.<br>
Step 5: Wait until a forum mod clears you and permits you to open signups.<br>
Step 6: In the Mafia Players thread, make a post about your game, including a basic flavor idea and the number of players needed. Wait for signups to finish.<br>
Step 7: Once signups finish, a forum mod should open a game thread for you.</div></div><br>

				Hello!<br>
<br>
We are re-vamping the SE and IC method. Please post comments on what you think of our new idea. zmann27 came up with this way to find suitable members of the community to fit the role. This might be changed later.<br>
<br>
<u><b>REQUIREMENTS:</b></u><br>
<br>
<b>SE STATUS:</b> Must have completed 3 Newbie or Regular Games.<br>
<b>IC STATUS:</b> Must have completed 5 Newbie or Regular Games AND must have modded or co-modded 1 game.<br>
<br>
<b>If you are applying, please follow this template (please provide links for Mafia Games Played):<br>
Status Applying For:<br>
Mafia Games Played:</b><br>
<br>
The mods have discussed a system of qualifications that we will use in the process of deciding whether you qualify as an SE.<br>
<br>
1. The player must have played 3 completed games (games in which that player played at least one full day with a somewhat significant number of posts and wasn't replaced).<br>
2. The player must be active enough so that we don't have huge activity issues.<br>
3. The player must demonstrate that they know how mafia works and are fluent in mafia terminology and conventions.<br>
4. The player must prove that they know how to find scum and construct some sort of logic that points toward someone being scum.<br>
5. The player doesn't have any other big issues (like a tendency to swear, or being modkilled in a game) that would prevent us from making him/her SE.<br>
<br>
To qualify as an IC, you must be a role model in the current mafia community.  Newbie players and SE's must look up to you and be able to ask you for help.<br>

				Hello Mafia Players,<br>
Based on the recent discussion in many of the Mafia Forum stickies, I think we need a new set of rules that is clear to all and will be best for the interests of the forum, its players, and its quality of games.  I have discussed these rules with some fellow moderators (others did not respond to my PM in the last few days; hence, why this list is "tentative") and modified the rules accordingly.<br>
<br>
These rules will be effective as soon as all players understand them and agree to them and we figure out exactly how many games each player has played in/playing in, etc.  Note that if you are in violation of any rules at the moment (for example, playing in too many games), this is not a problem; just don't join any new games until these rules say you can.<br>
<br>
<b>To preserve the integrity of the Mafia forum, do not create a topic within it unless you have been directly authorized to do so by PM by a moderator of the forum. Any violator of this rule will be warned, and any repeat violators will be suspended from participating in Mafia games indefinitely.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Rules for SE/IC:</b><br>
1) Any player with 3 or more games completed can apply to be an SE. Success is decided upon by forum mods and, to a lesser degree, the Mafia community.<br>
2) Any SE with 5 or more games completed can apply to be an IC. Success is decided upon by forum mods, and to a lesser degree, the Mafia community. Note the success rate will be lower, as IC is much more meaningful of a title than SE.<br>
3) Anyone who is not an SE or an IC will be referred to as a newbie, regardless of how many games they have completed.<br>
Note: The terms "newbie", "SE", and "IC" should not be used in any manner for determining sign-up lists of non-newbie games (unlike the typical 6-2-1 arrangement in newbie games) but should be kept in mind due to the game limit: see Rules for Game Players below.<br>
<br>
<b>Definition of a Completed Game:</b><br>
A game is considered "completed" by a player if:<br>
1) The player is not replaced until the end of the game.<br>
2) The player does not partake in activities/playstyles such as game-throwing, excessive fluff, etc.<br>
3) The game is not player-abandoned.<br>
Mod-abandoned games and replace-ins will be dealt with on a case-to-case basis. If you replace in early in a game, you will likely be considered as completing the game. (Example: me, in Mafia Game 57) If you replace late in the game, you will likely NOT be considered as completing the game. (No examples, but I'm sure you can find them) Mod-abandoned games in late-game states will likely be considered completed, mod-abandoned games in early-game states will likely NOT be considered completed BUT the game should be restarted with the same players and a better mod.<br>
<br>
Note: "games completed" do not necessarily have to be on AoPS.  If you send us (the moderators) a link to a forum (NOT chat or chat-style) game you have completed (such as one on mafiascum), and we see that your play is up to standards, that will count as a game completed.  However, we would like to see you play in AoPS before granting SE/IC status.<br>
<br>
<b>Rules for Game Players:</b><br>
1) A newbie with 0 completed games can only play in 1 game. That game must be a newbie game. Exceptions may be made on a case-to-case basis.<br>
2) A newbie with 1 completed game can only play in 2 games.<br>
3) A newbie with 2 or more completed games can play in any number of games.<br>
4) A newbie cannot be in more than 1 newbie game at a time. This is designed to increase opportunities for newer players to play more often.<br>
5) Do not discuss ongoing games without the permission of the moderator of that game.<br>
6) Do not post in games you are not participating in.<br>
7) Do not spam.<br>
8) Obey all instructions given by the moderator of a game which you are participating in provided that the instructions are related to said game and do not violate any forum rules.<br>
<br>
<b>Rules for Game Mods/Comods:</b><br>
1) All game mods must be SEs or ICs that have previously comodded a game.<br>
2) All game comods must have at least 2 completed games.<br>
3) If you mod-abandon a game or mod an unsuccessful game, you may not mod another game until you have successfully (actively, correctly, efficiently) comodded another game.<br>
<br>
These rules will be edited/updated/added to if necessary.  Feel free to discuss in this thread (but please, only in this thread, so that the other stickies can become less congested).<br>
<br>
Also, 2500th post.

				Welcome to Mafia Game 294: Genshin Mafia<br>
<b>Rules</b><br>
[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]<b>1.1:</b> Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.2:</b> Do not post at night.<br>
[*]<b>1.3:</b> You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]<b>1.4:</b> Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from me, including role PMs. Do not refer to private conversations with the moderator in any way unless given permission.<br>
[*]<b>1.5:</b> Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]<b>1.6:</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes size=1, hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others. This does not include adding extra spaces.<br>
[*]<b>1.7:</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.8:</b> If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]<b>1.9:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]<b>1.10:</b> Do not use the colors red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), green (#00FF00), or anything that appears similar, as these colors are used for modding purposes.<br>
[*]<b>1.11:</b> Confirm by listening to a song from Genshin Impact and posting in your role pm your analysis of the musical quality of the song and your feelings when listening to it.[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Hanging</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/code]</span><br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Activity</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>3.1:</b> Each day will be 336 hours (2 weeks). The moderator may extend the deadline for the end of the day at his/her discretion. Note that this will be unlikely.<br>
[*] <b>3.2:</b> The deadlines will follow the official <a href="https://www.time.gov/" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">time</a><br>
[*] <b>3.3:</b> The deadline will occur the very second 336 hours has occurred.<br>
[*] <b>3.4:</b> The night deadline will be 72 hours after night begins<br>
[*] <b>3.5:</b> When the night deadline is met, if the moderator does not receive a night action from either a player or his/her partner(s) (if you have them), the player will lose the chance to perform an action during that night.<br>
[*] <b>3.6:</b> Any night results will be sent after the night deadline<br>
[*] <b>3.7:</b> Night will end at some time after the night deadline when the mod makes the post announcing the end of night.<br>
[*] <b>3.8:</b> If a player does not post in a 48-hour period and he/she is not in V/LA, you will receive an in-game prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.9:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving an in-game prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.10:</b> If a player does not post in another 48-hour period after receiving a PM prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>
[*] <b>3.11:</b> If a player receives 5 PM Prods, he/she will be replaced<br>
[*] <b>3.12:</b> If a player is going to be V/LA, he/she must post in <b>bold</b> in-thread or PM me. The moderator will not prod the player unless the V/LA is too long.[list]</div><br>

He observed the humans within in the city of Mondstadt, how they lived their carefree lives each day, smiling, laughing, and having fun. A life that he himself could not have. Yet his counterpart lived among the people as one of them, living an undeserved life which was stolen from him.<br>
<br>
Now, a group of adventurers were climbing the mountain, seeking treasure or whatever it was that humans sought. Soon, he would take his place among them, and they would be none the wiser. A gust of wind filled the air with a flurry of snow, filling the area with white. When the snow dissipated, the unknown figure was gone.</div><br>

[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]Do not post at night.<br>
[*]You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from me, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]Day chat will be enabled via an AoPS private forum.<br>
[*]You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]Do not imitate the mods.[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Elimination</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]This game will partially use the voting rules philosophy of "if it looks like a vote, it's a vote". <b>So spelling/capitalization does not matter so long as the “Vote:” part is right, and the following two rules are met.</b><br>
[*]Post votes in bold font in the format "<b>Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;</b>", or c or code text: [code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/code].<br>
[*]Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*]You may vote for no elimination to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post "<b>Vote: No Elimination</b>" or: [code]Vote: No Elimination[/code].<br>
[*]You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though you have the ability to do so. Unvote in the format "<b>Unvote</b>" or: [code]Unvote[/code]. An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*]If the deadline is met the player with the most votes is eliminated. If there is a tie, the player who received the votes first is eliminated. If No Elimination is part of the tie, No Elimination occurs.<br>
[*]Starting day 2, If more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be eliminated. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*]Starting day 2, If at least half of the votes are for no elimination, then there will be no elimination. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline passes, it will be twilight and no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*]During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*]Once I (or the comod) post a end-of-day scene, the person eliminated (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Activity</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]Each day will be 240 hours (10 days). The moderator may extend the deadline for the end of the day at their discretion.<br>
[*]The deadline will occur the very second 240 hours has occurred.<br>
[*]The night deadline will be 48 hours after night begins.<br>
[*]When the night deadline is met, if the moderator does not receive a night action from either a player or his/her partner(s) (if you have them), the player will lose the chance to perform an action during that night.<br>
[*]Night will end at some time after the night deadline when the mod makes the post announcing the end of night.<br>
[*]If a player does not post in a 48-hour period and they are not in V/LA, you will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*]If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving a PM prod and they are not in V/LA, they will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player is going to be V/LA, they must PM me. The moderator will not prod the player unless the V/LA is too long.[list]</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Etiquette</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]Do not use inappropriate language or make personal attacks.<br>
[*]Be mature.<br>
[*]The game is to not be considered over until the mod declares it as such.<br>
[*]Don't intentionally/purposely gamethrow. If you believe you can no longer win talk to me in your role pm.<br>
[*]For a minor rule infraction, players can receive up to two warnings. If a player commits an infraction after they have run out of warnings, or commits a modkill level infraction, they may be modkilled or force replaced. Please do not make me modkill you.[/list]</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Story</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Seven new blank cards were picked to receive values today. To have the first chapter of their respective stories written. Each suit was requested to send a representative to the grand ceremony. However, the pesky Jokers caught wind of this, and decided to come ruin the ceremony.<br>
<br>
Not only this, but they were also able to convince one of the Suit Representatives to join them, for one reason or another. The blank cards were never going to be able to get their values now unless they can identify and put a stop to the Jokers.<br>
<br>
A first chapter to their stories, this would certainly be.</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Mafia are multitasking by default.<br>
<br>
The action resolution for this game is <a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">Reasonable Action Resolution.</a><br>
Private Chats are via AoPS forum with daychat enabled.<br>
No action may self-target.<br>
<br>
The setup is Suited13 (below).<br>
There was one final change since the second draft of the setup, which is that the Mafia Joat performing an action will appear as the suit to the Flavor Follower that the action is from, instead of as the mafia.<br>
<br>
<img src="./mg291MJisoV2_files/6ad3955e68e2755227b5d6bda59c29e30519747b.png" class="latexcenter" alt="\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Suited13 &amp; Spades &amp; Clubs &amp; Hearts &amp; Diamonds \\ \hline
3 pts &amp; Odd-Night Vigilante &amp; Personal Watcher &amp; Neapolitan &amp; Lazy Jailkeeper \\ \hline
2 pts &amp; Roleblocker &amp; Flavor Follower &amp; Doctor &amp; Indecisive Rolestopper \\ \hline
1 pt &amp; Universal Backup &amp; Motion Detector &amp; Compulsive Fruit Vendor &amp; 1-Shot Bulletproof \\ \hline
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ \hline
6 pts (A-7) &amp; 2-Shot Roleblocker &amp; Tracker &amp; Combined Fruit Vendor Rolecop &amp; Rolecop \\ \hline
5 pts (8-K) &amp; Informed &amp; Informed &amp; Goon &amp; Informed \\ \hline
\end{tabular}" width="856" height="145"><br>
To generate the setup, a card will be drawn at random from a standard deck. The suit and # determine the column and row for the mafia’s role. The town will then receive one role from each of the other three columns, summing up to the same number of points.<br>
A-6 represent the six ways to have a 3/2/1 point split. <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Specifically</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">After removing the scum role's column, there are three columns left. An Ace would indicate taking the 3 points role from the left of those, the 2 points from the middle and 1 point from the right. A 2 would still mean taking the 3 points role from the left, but the 2 points role from the right and 1 point from the middle. Etc through the six permutations.</div><br>
7 indicates all three two point roles.<br>
8-10 represents the three ways to have a 2/2/1 point split.<br>
J-K represent the three ways to have a 3/1/1 point split.<br>
<br>
Then 7 Vanilla Townies, 1 Mafia Joat (Flavor Follower, Roleblocker, Rolestopper) and 1 Mafia Goon will be added and roles will be distributed.<br>

Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a BLANK Card (Vanilla Townie). After being told you would receive a value today, that no longer seems guaranteed to be true. It looks to be in your hands to ensure that the ceremony can go on and catch the Jokers. You have no abilities other than your voice and your vote.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>

[quote=King of Spades (Odd-Night Vigilante)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a King of Spades (Town Odd-Night Vigilante). Instead of sending a representative, you felt the need to oversee the ceremony yourself. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough, and you need to take action. On each odd numbered night, you may attempt to kill a player.<br>
<br>

[quote=Ten of Spades (Roleblocker)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Ten of Spades (Town Roleblocker). You were sent to the ceremony on behalf of the Spades to ensure nothing went wrong. After the ceremony's disruption, you have decided to act as a strong wall to prevent any further chaos. Each night, you may attempt to roleblock a player, preventing their action(s).<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>

[quote=Ace of Spades (Universal Backup)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are an Ace of Spades (Town Universal Backup). You were sent to the ceremony on behalf of the Spades to ensure nothing went wrong. You aren't prepared to do anything yet, but it never hurts a team to have an Ace up their sleeves. Upon the death of the first Town aligned power role, you gain their abilities.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>
[/quote]<br>
[quote=Queen of Clubs (Personal Watcher)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Queen of Clubs (Town Personal Watcher). It was a very personal matter to you that you specifically watched the ceremony. Unfortunately, now you need to watch for who did what to sort out this mess. Each night, you may attempt to watch a player, to learn who used an action on them, besides the mafia's factional kill. Possible results are a list of one or more names (including repeats), nobody, or 'No Result'.<br>
<br>

[quote=Jack of Clubs (Flavor Follower)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Jack of Clubs (Town Flavor Follower). The Queen sent you personally to watch over the ceremony. You are familiar with all the suits, and use that to your advantage. Each night, you may attempt to follow a player, to learn the suit of any action they use that night. Possible results are a list of one or more of Spades, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Jokers (specifically for the faction kill), none, or 'No Result'.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>

[quote=Two of Clubs (Motion Detector)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Two of Clubs (Town Motion Detector). The Queen sent you, the least of the Clubs, to watch over the ceremony. And now that things have gone wrong, you know you need to not disappoint. Each night, you may attempt to learn if there was motion around a player; defined as either them using an action or a player that isn't you using an action on them that night. Possible results are Motion, No Motion, or 'No Result'.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>

[quote=Five of Hearts (Neapolitan)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Five of Hearts (Town Neapolitan). You were sent by the King to witness the ceremony, and found a list of who was in to take detailed notes. That list is looking pretty useful now, but unfortunately, the blank cards that everyone is or is pretending to be aren't easy to distinguish so it takes some careful comparisons to determine who is on your list. Each night, you may attempt to learn if a player is a Blank Card. Possible results are Vanilla Townie, Not a Vanilla Townie, or 'No Result'.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>
[/quote]<br>
[quote=Nine of Hearts (Doctors)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Nine of Hearts (Town Doctor). You were sent by the King to witness the ceremony, and always try to share your hearts. That list is looking pretty necessary right now, as who knows what tricks the Jokers will try. Each night, you may attempt to protect a player from up to one kill attempt.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>
[/quote]<br>
[quote=King of Hearts (Compulsive Fruit Vendor)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a King of Hearts (Town Compulsive Fruit Vendor). You decided to watch over the ceremony yourself, and naturally, brought enough fruit to share. This fruit must be handed out, as if you try to take it back to your kingdom it will go bad. Each night, you must select a player to attempt to give a piece of fruit to. Failure to do so will result in your target being randomized.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>

[quote=Fruit Message]You received a piece of fruit last night.[/quote]<br>
[quote=Eight of Diamonds (Lazy Jailkeeper)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are an Eight of Diamonds (Town Lazy Jailkeeper). You were sent to watch over the ceremony and keep everyone in line. However, this has not been happening, so you will need to step up at least until most of the troublemakers are taken care of. Each night where there is more than one mafia alive, you may select a player to attempt to both prevent their action and protect them from all kills that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>
[/quote]<br>
[quote=Three of Diamonds (Indecisive Rolestopper)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Three of Diamonds (Town Indecisive Rolestopper). You were sent to watch over the ceremony and keep everyone in line, but are underconfident. However, now you will have to step up, even as you're questioning your decisions. Each night, you may select a player different to the one you selected the previous night (if any) to attempt to prevent all other actions targeting them that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>
[/quote]<br>
[quote=Ace of Diamonds (1-Shot Bulletproof)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are an Ace of Diamonds (Town 1-Shot Bulletproof). You were sent to watch over the ceremony, but as a valuable card you keep yourself secured at all times. The first time you a kill at night would succeed on you, you instead survive.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia (Jokers and their ally) are dead.<br>

[quote=Black Joker (Mafia Goon)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Black Joker (Mafia Goon). You and the Red Joker (USERNAME) have hatched a plan to disrupt the ceremony of seven new cards gaining their value. You were also able to convince one suited card (USERNAME) to help out your cause, or perhaps that's just a clone of you and you tied down the card you were trying to convince somewhere, it's hard to say for sure.<br>
<br>
You have a factional kill, and a factional private chat which the link to will be in the next message.<br>
<br>
You win when out of living players your faction reaches parity with the Town.<br>

[quote=Red Joker (Mafia Joat)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>
<br>
Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Red Joker (Mafia Joat (Flavor Follower, Roleblocker, Rolestopper)). You and the Black Joker (USERNAME) have hatched a plan to disrupt the ceremony of seven new cards gaining their value. They convinced one suited card (USERNAME) to help out your cause, or perhaps that's just Black Joker's clone, it's hard to say for sure. You have access to some abilities which you have learned from intently studying other cards. Each night you may perform one of the following abilities that you haven't attempted to perform before:<br>
Flavor Follower - You may attempt to learn the suit(s) of actions performed by a target player. Possible results are a list of one or more of Spades, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Jokers (specifically for the faction kill), none, or 'No Result'.<br>
Roleblocker - You may attempt to prevent a target player's action(s).<br>
Rolestopper - You may attempt to prevent all other actions targeting a selected player.<br>
<br>
You have a factional kill, and a factional private chat which the link to will be in the next message.<br>

You win when out of living players your faction reaches parity with the Town.<br>

[quote=Six of Something (Mafia Informed)]<br>
Hello USERNAME,<br>

Welcome to Mafia Game 293, you are a Six of Something (Mafia Informed). You have decided to join forces with the Black Joker (USERNAME) and Red Joker (USERNAME) to put an end to this ceremony. After all, your ink has faded so badly, it's hard to tell what suit you even are; why should these new cards all get fresh ink when you're stuck like this? Additionally, you know that you are a {Spade/Club/Diamond} and as such there are no Town Power Roles from that suit. This information will be removed upon your flip.<br>
<br>
You have a factional kill, and a factional private chat which the link to will be in the next message.<br>
<br>
You win when out of living players your faction reaches parity with the Town.<br>

<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mod, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mod.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mod.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mod in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mod for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<b>Mechanics</b> (credits to Game 208)<br>
<br>
The game will begin during Night 0. Night 0 will last for 48 hours. Before then, each player will get their alignment. Once alignments have been randomized, Mafia will be able to talk to each other, and during this time and Night 0, they will determine which Power Roles will be in the game. They must select 3 distinct Power Roles for Town from this list: {Innocent Child, Tracker, 1-Shot Cop, Jailkeeper, 2-Shot Vigilante}. Note that there is no kill during Night 0. Once the roles have been selected, they will be randomized among town, players will get their new Role PM, and Day 1 will begin.<br>

<b>Rules</b><br>
[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]<b>1.1:</b> Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.2:</b> Do not post at night.<br>
[*]<b>1.3:</b> You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]<b>1.4:</b> Do not talk about this game outside of this topic or the mafia chat to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]<b>1.5:</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes size=1, hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others. This does not include adding extra spaces.<br>
[*]<b>1.6:</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.7:</b> If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]<b>1.8:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]<b>1.10:</b> Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the moderator, including role PMs. To verify your existence, name a song from the album This Place Will Become Your Tomb.<br>
[*]<b>1.9:</b> Out of game information and angleshooting are extremely banned. If you are unsure whether something breaks this rule, ask me in your role PM or just don't do it.<br>
[*]<b>1.10:</b> Do not claim or otherwise discuss your flavorname.[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Hanging</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in bold or code tags in the format [code]<b>Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;</b>[/code] or [code][code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/‎code][/code]<br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like <b>Vote: fdas</b> or [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post: <b>Vote: No Hang</b> or [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> Unvote in the format <b>Vote: Unvote</b> or [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any. You are not required to unvote before making a new vote.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met, the player with the highest number of votes will be hanged. If two or more players have the same amount of votes, the hang will be randomized between these players. If no hang is tied with a player or players, there will be no hang.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post an end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.<br>
[*] <b>2.13:</b> People are hanged, not hung. While this wording entertains me, it is also slightly painful to see.[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Activity</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>3.1:</b> Each day will be 192 hours (8 days). The moderator may extend the deadline for the end of the day at their discretion. Note that this will be unlikely.<br>
[*] <b>3.2:</b> The deadline will occur the very second 192 hours has occurred.<br>
[*] <b>3.3:</b> The night deadline will be 48 hours after night begins.<br>
[*] <b>3.4:</b> When the night deadline is met, if the moderator does not receive a night action from either a player or their partner(s) (if applicable), the player will lose the chance to perform an action during that night.<br>
[*] <b>3.5:</b> Any night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*] <b>3.6:</b> Night will end at some time after the night deadline when the mod makes the post announcing the end of night.<br>
[*] <b>3.7:</b> If a player does not post in a 48-hour period and they are not in V/LA, they will receive an in-game prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.8:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving an in-game prod and they are not in V/LA, they will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.9:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving a PM prod and they are not in V/LA, they will be replaced unless they post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>
[*] <b>3.10:</b> If a player receives 5 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*] <b>3.11:</b> To request a V/LA, post in <b>bold</b> in-thread or PM me. The moderator will not prod the player during their V/LA as long as it is within reason. If you need to take an excessively long V/LA, you may be encouraged to replace out of the game.<br>
[*]<b>3.12:</b> If a player does not reach a minimum of 15 posts by the end of a complete day cycle, they will be replaced. I will warn you in PMs if you have not reached this minimum 72 hours before the end of the day. This does not count towards your PM prod total.[list]</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Etiquette</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>4.1:</b> Do not use inappropriate language.<br>
[*] <b>4.2:</b>  Do not make any personal attacks.<br>
[*] <b>4.3:</b>  Follow all of the rules.<br>
[*] <b>4.4:</b>  Be mature.<br>
[*] <b>4.5:</b>  For a minor rule infraction, players can receive up to 2 warnings. All players can receive up to 3 warnings without further punishment. If a player commits an infraction after they have run out of warnings, or commits a modkill level infraction, they will be modkilled or force replaced. Please do not make me modkill you.[/list]</div><br>

[*] <b>5.1:</b> I, candythecorgi, am the moderator of Mafia Game 289.<br>
[*] <b>5.2:</b> My mod colors will be #3D85C6 and #0B5394. Do not attempt to emulate a moderator message.<br>
[*] <b>5.7:</b> The moderator may change the rules at any time.<br>
[*] <b>5.8:</b> The moderator has the last say in interpreting the rules.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*] Read all of the rules.[/list]<br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">This game will use the Matrix15, or Matrix Mayhem 5x5, setup.<br>
<br>
IMAGE<br>
<br>
The setup is determined by randomly selecting one row or column from the above matrix, and then adding 9 Vanilla Townies and 1 Mafia Goon. This will always result in 12 Town members (3 of which are Power Roles) and 3 Mafia members (1 or 2 of which are Power Roles).<br>
<br>
[LIST]<br>
[*]For example, if Column A was randomly selected, the setup would be a Town 3-shot Tracker, Town JOAT, Town Odd Night Doctor, 9 Vanilla Townies, Mafia 2-shot Watcher, Mafia Roleblocker, and Mafia Goon.<br>
[/LIST]<br>
<br>
Mafia flips will only reveal the <b>alignment</b> of the Mafia player, whereas Town flips will reveal the <b>full role</b> of the Town player.<br>
The following roles are <b>non-consecutive</b> (cannot target the same player 2 nights in a row): Town 3-shot Roleblocker and Town Inventor (1x Track, 1x Roleblock.<br>
The following roles are <b>disabled in endgame</b> (deactivated when only one Mafia is alive): Town 3-shot Roleblocker and Town 3-shot Tracker.<br>
<br>
Each of the Town JOAT's abilities may only be used <b>once</b> throughout the game.</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Role PMs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Refer <a href="https://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/threads/4062-Modbot-Supported-Roles-Modifiers" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">here</a> for descriptions of all possible roles. If you have further questions, ask me in your role PM.<br>
<br>
Each player has a unique flavorname and role PM. <b>Do not claim or otherwise discuss your flavorname in this game thread or any other public threads.</b> This may result in a modkill based on my discretion.<br>
<br>
Mafia will receive fakeclaims upon request.</div><br>

				Welcome to Mafia Game 288: Gemstone Mafia<br>
<br>
<b>Important Rules:<br>
Do not edit or delete posts<br>
Do not post during night<br>
Do not post if you are dead or if you are not in the game<br>
Do not talk about anything related to this game outside this thread<br>
Read all the rules!<br>
</b><br>
<br>
<b>Rules</b><br>
[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]<b>1.1:</b> Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.2:</b> Do not post at night.<br>
[*]<b>1.3:</b> You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]<b>1.4:</b> Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]<b>1.5:</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes size=1, hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others. This does not include adding extra spaces.<br>
[*]<b>1.6:</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.7:</b> If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]<b>1.8:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]<b>1.9:</b> Do not use the colors red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), green (#00FF00), or anything that appears similar, as these colors are used for modding purposes.<br>
[*]<b>1.10:</b> Confirm your participation in the game by making a post stating the important rules[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Hanging</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format [code][code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/‎code][/code]<br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

[*] <b>3.9:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving an in-game prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.10:</b> If a player does not post in another 48-hour period after receiving a PM prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>

<br>
You live in the Box of Treasure and you are proud of being a gemstone and not a mineral. You cannot wait to let the gemstones completely populate the Box of Treasure again, and you believe that minerals do not have a place there.<br>
<br>
You have no other power besides your vote and your voice.<br>
<br>
You win when all the minerals are eliminated from the Box of Treasure.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Sapphire (Town Cop)</b>.<br>
<br>
You love living in the Box of Treasure, so you were devastated to hear that there were possible minerals living among you. Determined to find out who were the imposters, you took the initiative to become the cop of the Box of Treasure. You lurk around at night to see who is a mineral.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target one player to find out their alignment.<br>
<br>
You win when all the minerals are eliminated from the Box of Treasure.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Emerald (Town Doctor)</b>.<br>
<br>
After hearing the news about possible minerals living amongst you, you quickly realized that it meant some innocent gemstones dying and being kicked out of the Box of Treasure. You decided to take on the role of a doctor, healing gemstones and protecting them from dying. You decide that it is not worth it to kill gemstones who clearly have not done anything wrong.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target someone to prevent them from dying that night. You may not heal yourself two nights in a row.<br>
<br>
You win when all the minerals are eliminated from the Box of Treasure.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Aquamarine (Town Tracker)</b>.<br>
<br>
You started being suspicious of some of your fellow "gemstones" in the Box of Treasure when the news came out about possible mineral infiltrators. Every night, you decided, you would sneak around and stalk people to see what they do at night. You think this is the best way to sniff out those mineral imposters.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target one player to find out who they visited that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all the minerals are eliminated from the Box of Treasure.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Ruby (Town Jailkeeper)</b>.<br>
<br>
You were given the job of jailkeeper in the Box of Treasure. You love your job, and you feel that it is your responsibility to help keep the minerals away. You guard a small jail cell in the corner of the Box of Treasure, and you make sure to always do your job as a responsible gemstone.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target one player to jailkeep. Your target will not be able to perform any action that night, and all nightkill attempts against your target that night will be blocked.<br>
<br>
You win when all the minerals are eliminated from the Box of Treasure.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Diamond (1-Shot Bulletproof Townie)</b>.<br>
<br>
As one of the strongest gemstones that exist, you have a one-time-use protective layer around you that blocks any mineral from trying to throw you out of the Box of Treasures at night. You are proud of being a strong gemstones and sometimes wish that others can be as strong as you.<br>
<br>
The first time that a mineral tries to kill you at night, that kill will be negated.<br>
<br>
You win when all the minerals are eliminated from the Box of Treasure.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Amethyst (Mafia Goon)</b>.<br>
<br>
You once really wanted to join the gemstones in the Box of Treasure, but they rejected you, calling you nothing but "purple quartz". Now that you have snuck into the Box of Treasure, you are ready to get rid of all the gemstones and let the true rulers - minerals, rule.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target one player to eliminate them from the Box of Treasure. You may also talk to your fellow mineral partner here.<br>
<br>
You win when all of the gemstones have been eliminated or nothing can prevent this.[/quote]<br>
<br>
[quote]You are <b>Calcite (Mafia Roleblocker)</b>.<br>
<br>
You were disappointed when you were rejected from entering the Box of Treasure, but you were okay with it. However, you agreed to help your good mineral friend in bringing the gemstones down when you heard that they were going to sneak into the Box of Treasure. Now you are waiting for your moment for you and you friend to strike.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target one player to roleblock. Your target will not be able to perform any action that night. This action takes precedence over the Jailkeeper. You may also talk to your fellow mineral partner here.<br>
<br>
You win when all of the gemstones have been eliminated or nothing can prevent this.[/quote]</div><br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>

<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 2, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><i>"He who controls the spice controls the world" - Baron Harkonnen</i><br>
<br>
This game is based on a closed setup with two or more factions.<br>
<br>
<b>Game-Specific Mechanics:</b><br>
<br>
<b>Spice Income:</b> Each player will have an income in spice that they will receive at the end of each night. Spice is extremely important to the mechanics of the game. In addition, each player will start with 5 spice.<br>
<b>Sandstorms:</b> On the planet of Dune, sometimes sandstorms occur. A sandstorm will occur for every 50 spice spent. Sandstorms will be announced at EOD; when a sandstorm occurs, players without immunity will not receive their income that night. There cannot be a sandstorm on Night 1.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, there are 2 phases in this game:<br>
<br>
<b>Day:</b> At the beginning of day, the moderators will announce any night kills and also the <b>Spice Leader</b> (player with the most spice, in the case of a tie one of the players with the most spice will be chosen randomly) will receive a <b>Spice Checker</b> which they may use on any player <b>during the day</b> to determine how much spice that player currently has. The Spice Checker must be used on the day it is given and is a one-time-use. During the day, players will discuss who to hang.<br>
<b>Night: </b>During the night, players will perform their respective night actions, if applicable, and will receive their income (or not, in the case of a Sandstorm) at the end of the night. All players will be told the amount of spice they have at the end of the night.<br>
<br>
<b>Additional Information:</b><br>
[list][*]All night actions will be resolved using Reasonable Night Action Resolution.<br>
[*]The game is not BM, although borderline BM elements may exist.<br>
[*]You may claim flavornames, however be aware that anti-town faction(s) will be provided with fakeclaims.[/list]<br>

As a Fremen citizen, you are vaguely aware of the power struggle going on on your planet, and have agreed to join the Atreides. Each night, you may transfer up to 50% of your spice to another player.<br>

You win when one or more members of the <b>Atreides</b> faction are alive, and when you have eliminated all antitown. Play toward your win condition, and good luck![/quote]</div></div><br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

<br>
[list][*]All times will be in Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) as applicable, unless otherwise noted.<br>
[*]Each day phase will be 168 hours (7 days), and each night phase will be 48 hours (2 days).<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<b>Causing significant disruptions to gameplay may result in a force replacement at the moderators' discretion.<br>

Hello, [player]!<br>
<br>
You are a <b>Funiculus (Mafia Goon)</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>There's something growing inside of you. You knew from the moment you woke up with blood smeared all over your face that the sick, sinking feeling in your stomach was not just a feeling. The only way for you to live now is for you to find a way to get out of the garden and get to a medlab. But if the others find out...</i><br>
<br>
Your partner is <b>[player] ([role])</b>, and you may discuss with them in <a href="http://bit.ly/MafQT" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">this private forum</a> while you are alive. The two of you will be able to choose a player to kill each night, as well as decide who makes the kill.<br>
<br>
You win when the Mafia are the only ones left, or if nothing can prevent this, so your goal is to stay hidden and kill Town. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>

				Welcome to Mafia Game 285, Oops! All PRs! Mafia!<br>
<br>
<b>If you are not playing in this game, you are <i><u>not</u></i> allowed to post in this thread.</b><br>
<br>
Credits to Binomial-theorem/chaotic_iak/willwang123/zmann27 for the basic template (many changes have been made).<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Story</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">We live in an egalitarian society nowadays. No more such thing as men and woman. No such thing as white or black. No such thing as fdas, xantho, NeilOnnsu. No such things as <i>names</i>. Everyone is exactly the same. Cops? Don't need them; everyone is a cop. Doctors? Don't need them; everyone is a doctor.<br>
<br>
Everyone is the same. Except for a few people. They desired what they could not have. <i>Individuality.</i> And they struck.<br>
<br>
<strike>pandabear10</strike> Someone has been killed. They were a Townie.</div><br>
<br>
<b>Read ALL of the rules!</b><br>
[list]<br>
[*] To confirm, please type <b>Confirm</b>. By doing so, you acknowledge that you can and will be held responsible to the ruleset below.<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">General Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>R.1.</b> Read the rules. All of them. Every single one. Including this one. No exceptions. Whatsoever. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
<b>R.2.</b> Bookmark this thread. It makes things easier for everyone. To bookmark, click the button that looks like a bookmark: <span class="aops-font">B</span>. You know that you have done this when the aforementioned button appears like this: <span class="aops-font">C</span>, <span class="aops-font">D</span>, <span class="aops-font">E</span>, or <span class="aops-font">F</span>.<br>
<b>R.3.</b> Do not post during night, as defined in <b>A.5</b>.<br>
<b>R.4.</b> Do not post an excessive amount of images or GIF's in your posts. <b>This rule is subject to moderator interpretation.</b> Pre-warnings will be given before I give a warning based on this rule.<br>
<b>R.5.</b> Do not spam or have excessive white-space in your post. <b>This rule is subject to moderator interpretation.</b> Pre-warnings will be given before I give a warning based on this rule.<br>
<b>R.6.</b> You may PM me through your Role PM at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification or role clarification. Please do not send me new PM's regarding this game. I will not guarantee a straight or truthful answer, however. Note that I cannot reveal anything about other players.<br>
<b>R.7.</b> Roleclaiming is allowed. (Not sure how this would benefit you, though.)<br>
<b>R.8.</b> While this game is ongoing, do not talk substantively about this game outside of this thread to anyone other than me (pandabear10) with the exception of any QuickTopics (or other modes of communication) I explicitly give to you. <u>Stating that this game exists and asking someone in the game to be active is explicitly defined to not be substantive.</u> <b>Depending on the severity, breaking this rule is a modkill level infraction, and may be additionally subject to further punishment outside of this game.</b><br>
<b>R.9.</b> If you are dead, do not post anything substantive about the game anywhere, including in thread, other than the Dead QuickTopic that you will receive after death, and the Role PM, which is a suitable place to type personal commentary on the game, if you so wish. <u>Prodding people while dead is an infraction of this rule, unlike in <b>R.8</b>.</u> You may still spectate the game. <b>Depending on the severity, breaking this rule is a modkill level infraction, and may be additionally subject to further punishment outside of this game.</b><br>
<b>R.10.</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes, but is not limited to size=1, hide=".", color=#fff, color=transparent, phantom, and color=white.<br>
<b>R.11.</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted under any circumstance. If you would like to clarify or change anything that has already been posted, you may utilize EBWOP (Edit By Way Of Post) or EBWON (Edit By Way Of Post / Edit By Way Of Ninja'd), although anything on the line of "Edit:" will be understood by most players.<br>
<b>R.12.</b> Play towards your win condition as dictated by the rules and in your Role PM.<br>
<b>R.13.</b> The only text in-thread that I can guarantee that I will read is <b>bolded text that is not in a <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">hide tag</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">&nbsp;</div> and is at least of font-size 100.</b> As such, if you want to ask me a question, either use your Role PM, or bold your question.<br>
<b>R.14.</b> Have fun. If you aren't having fun, this will most likely affect other players. Please just ask for a replacement if you are not having fun.</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Etiquette</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>E.1.</b> Do not use inappropriate language. You kids know what I mean when I say this. If AoPS censors it for you, don't try to circumvent it.<br>
<b>E.2.</b> Be mature and considerate.<br>
<b>E.3.</b> Do not make any personal attacks, make sure to attack the person's role. For example, 'I believe you are scum in real life' will draw a warning, but 'You seem scummy' will not draw a warning. Since phrases like, 'I believe you are scum' are often said, a warning in this rule will only be given if it is clearly evident that this rule has been broken intentionally. <b>This rule is subject to moderator interpretation.</b><br>
<b>E.4.</b> For minor rule infractions, if a newbie accumulates three warnings, (s)he will be force replaced or modkilled, and SE's or IC's will be force replaced or modkilled at two warnings. <b>The moderator and the moderator alone makes the decision to force-replace or modkill, and the decision will be made on a case-by-case basis.</b> However, generally speaking, if game-critical information has not been divulged, a player will be force-replaced. In addition, if a replacement cannot be found within 168 hours, the player will automatically be modkilled. Modkills will not end day as defined in <b>A.1</b>.</div><br>
<br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Activity</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>A.1.</b> 'Day' is the time period where players may post in this thread. A mafia-day will normally be about 14 real-life days long, depending on the moderators' availability. Once someone is hanged, it will become twilight.<br>
<b>A.2.</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, no hang will automatically take place, and the day will proceed to be twilight. No votes will be processed after the deadline, even if the moderator fails to immediately end day.<br>
<b>A.3.</b> Twilight is the time period between when the a player is hanged (after Day 1) or when the deadline passes (all days), and when an end-of-day scene is posted. Once the end-of-day scene is posted, night will immediately commence.<br>
<b>A.4.</b> A night-action is an action granted by receiving a certain role in-game. The PM will say what their night-action is and how to use it. Night actions may not be submitted during the day. The Vanilla Townie role does not have a night-action.<br>
<b>A.5.</b> 'Night' is the time period where players who have a designated night-action may submit their night-action. No posts may take place in-thread during this time. Each night will be three (3) real-life days long, depending on the moderators' availability. Night may be cut short if all night-actions have been submitted. Once night has been declared over by the moderator, the next day will immediately begin.<br>
<b>A.6.</b> The moderator may extend the deadline for the day or night <i>at their discretion</i>, but this will be unlikely. The two main reasons I might extend the deadline is if someone (including the moderator) is V/LA at the deadline, or if a replacement occurs close to the deadline. <b>However, never count on a deadline extension.</b><br>
<b>A.7.</b> When the night deadline is reached, all night-actions must have been submitted. If the moderator does not receive a night action from either a player or his/her partner(s) (if you have them) before the deadline, the player(s) will lose the chance to perform their action during that night. Mafia may submit their kill either in their role PM or in their QuickTopic or other moderator-provided method of communication. If multiple conflicting kills are submitted, the Mafia chat gets first priority, then the most recent PM containing a kill.<br>
<b>A.8.</b> If a player does not post in a 48-hour period, he/she will receive an in-game prod.<br>
<b>A.9.</b> If a player does not post in another 48-hour period after receiving an in-game prod as defined in <b>A.8</b>, he/she will receive a PM Prod.<br>
<b>A.10.</b> If a player does not post in another 48-hour period after receiving a PM Prod as defined in <b>A.9</b>, he/she will be replaced unless he/she posts before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>
<b>A.11.</b> If a player accumulates 5 PM Prods, he/she will be replaced regardless of any future activity. Continued posting will <b>not</b> prevent replacement.<br>
<b>A.12.</b> If a player is going to be V/LA (Vacation / Leave of Absence), the player should post in <b>bold</b> in-thread, containing the dates of the V/LA. For example, a V/LA declaration can look like, "<b>V/LA from 9/1/2016 - 9/5/2016.</b>" Dates will be read by the moderator by default as "<u>mm/dd/yyyy</u>" or "<u>mm/dd/yy</u>". Alternatively, the player may PM me in your designated Role PM thread. I will not give you any prods during a V/LA, but if you request a V/LA longer than 10 days, I will just replace you instead. It is not necessary for formatting to be exact for a V/LA, however, I cannot guarantee that I will catch an in-thread declaration of a V/LA that is not bolded.<br>
<b>A.13.</b> <b>Players should not ask for semi-V/LA's.</b> Players must use their best judgment to decide if the partial-inactivity is worth declaring a V/LA for. Semi-V/LA's will not be acknowledged under any circumstance.<br>
<b>A.14.</b> If a player wishes to be replaced, the player must post in <b>bold</b> in-thread something of the form of '<b>Request Replacement.</b>' I will not be picky with the formatting with this, as long as I can understand that you wish to be replaced. Alternatively, the player may PM me that the party wishes to be replaced.</div><br>
<br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Hangings &amp; Voting</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>H.1.</b> Votes are defined as text with the format [code]Vote: &lt;username&gt;[/code], where &lt;username&gt; is a player in the game. <u>Everything in the vote must be properly spaced, spelled, formatted, and capitalized.</u> The <b>only</b> exception to this rule is upper capitalization of the first letter of a username. So, if pandabear10 were playing in this game, [code]Vote: Pandabear10[/code] would be acceptable, as well as [code]Vote: pandabear10[/code]. Examples of invalid votes include, but are not limited to, <b>Vote: pandabear10</b>, [code]Vote pandabear10[/code], [code]vote: pandabear10[/code], <i>Vote: pandabear10</i>, or [code]Vote:pandabear10[/code]. Nicknames are also unacceptable, so [code]Vote: panda[/code] is also not considered a valid vote. All invalid votes will be ignored.<br>
<b>H.2.</b> <b>Do not intentionally fake-vote.</b> This is for my own sanity, as I read all posts manually for votes. If I count a fake vote and that ends up with real consequences, then that's on you.<br>
<b>H.3.</b> You may vote for no one to be hanged to occur during a day. Vote for this scenario by voting: [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]. Rules <b>H.1 - H.2</b> apply.<br>
<b>H.4.</b> Unvote exactly in the format [code]Unvote[/code] or [code]Vote: Unvote[/code], with the exception of capitalization of "Unvote" (ie: [code]unvote[/code] or [code]Vote: unvote[/code] is acceptable). An unvote will remove a current vote if any exists. You do not have to unvote before making a new vote.<br>
<b>H.5.</b> If at any point in a day other than Day 1 <b>strictly more</b> than half of the players alive are voting for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight, as defined in <b>A.3</b>. Votes are parsed sequentially through a post. If a hang is reached in the middle of a post, any and all subsequent votes will be ignored, even if the person unvotes said vote.<br>
<b>H.6.</b> If at any point in a day other than Day 1 <b>at least</b> half of the players alive are voting for the scenario of no hang, then the scenario of no hang will occur. It will then immediately be twilight, as defined in <b>A.3</b>.<br>
<b>H.7.</b> <b>If the current day is Day 1</b>, the day is never terminated early, even if <b>H.5</b> or <b>H.6</b> are otherwise satisfied. Once the deadline is reached, a player is hanged if <b>H.5</b> is satisfied, and a no hang occurs otherwise.<br>
<b>H.8.</b> The moment the deadline passes, or if a hang or the scenario of no-hang occurs past Day 1, no more votes will be counted, even if the mod or co-mod has not made a post confirming a hang or no-hang.<br>
<b>H.9.</b> A person that is hanged may still post until the day is officially ended by a moderator.<br>
<b>H.10.</b> Once I post an end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead, and may no longer post. Night, as defined in <b>A.5</b>, then immediately begins.<br>
<b>H.11.</b> If a person is killed during night, I will reveal this at the beginning of the next day. The said person or persons will then be officially dead, and may no longer post for the remaining duration of the game.</div><br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup and Mechanics</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>S.1.</b> This game utilizes an open setup. There are nine (9) town and two separate mafia factions (which are called mafia and werewolves to distinguish them) with mutually exclusive win conditions.<br>
<b>S.2.</b> Mafia and werewolves have daychat.<br>
<b>S.3.</b> Town's win condition is for all mafia and werewolves to be dead.<br>
<b>S.4.</b> Mafia and werewolves' win condition is to make up a strict majority of all living players. That is, the game ends in victory for mafia (or werewolves) if there are <img src="./mg291MJisoV2_files/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" class="latex" alt="$n$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="13" height="10"> total people alive, with <img src="./mg291MJisoV2_files/4354f3c399b245503f9741844bf4723d6b7dfdce.png" class="latex" alt="$\left\lceil \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rceil$" style="vertical-align: -18px" width="69" height="45"> of those players being mafia (or werewolves). <b>In particular, if the game reaches a scenario where all players die, town wins and mafia and werewolves both lose.</b><br>
<b>S.5.</b> During each night, all alive town players may choose (but are not compelled to) perform a night action in one of three categories: investigator, protector, and blocker, as well as a target of the action. The power of a role is equal to the number of <b>town</b> players that attempt to perform the same category of night action during that night. Low power is strongest. The power determines exactly what type of action that the player performs.<br>
<b>S.6.</b> The possible actions that are possible to perform, sorted first by action type, then by power, is as follows:<br>
Investigator:<br>
[list]<br>
[*] Power &lt;= 1: Cop (At the end of night, I will inform the player as to whether their target is innocent (town) or guilty (mafia or werewolf).<br>
[*] Power 2: Tracker (At the end of the night, I will inform the player as to who their target themselves targeted, if any.)<br>
[*] Power 3: Motion Detector (At the end of the night, I will inform the player "motion detected" if the target either targeted someone or was themselves targeted, or "no motion detected" if neither happened.<br>
[*] Power 4: No action (At the end of the night, I will inform the player that their action failed somehow.)<br>
[/list]<br>
Protector (self-targeting is allowed):<br>
[list]<br>
[*] Power &lt;= 1: Doctor (Your target will survive a single night kill attempt during this night.)<br>
[*] Power 2: Toxic Doctor (If your target has not accumulated any toxins, your target will survive a single night kill attempt during this night. After this night, your target will have accumulated toxins and will not be eligible to be protected by any toxic doctor for the remainder of the game.)<br>
[*] Power 3: Bodyguard (If your target is targeted for a kill, you will die instead of the intended target. Only redirects a single kill. If you self-target, bodyguard does nothing.)<br>
[*] Power 4: No action (You protect no one.)<br>
[/list]<br>
Blocker (self-targeting is not allowed):<br>
[list]<br>
[*] Power &lt;= 1: Kill Roleblocker (Your target will be blocked from submitting any killing actions this night, i.e. mafia and werewolf factional kills.)<br>
[*] Power 2: Roleblocker (Your target will be blocked from performing any night action this night. If the target performed an investigative role, they will be told that their action failed somehow.)<br>
[*] Power 3: Delayer (Your target will be blocked from performing any night action this night, however, they will automatically perform the same action, if possible, the next night. This is in addition to any action that they might attempt the following night. The delayed action is not blockable. Investigative roles will be told that their action failed somehow, but will receive a result the following night.)<br>
[*] Power 4: No action (You block no one.)<br>
[/list]<br>
<b>S.7.</b> Each anti-town team (mafia and werewolves) get six one-time-use ability charges (Power 1 and 2 investigator, Power 1 &amp; 2 protector, Power 2 &amp; 3 blocker) that they may use over the course of the entire game. A mafia player may only use at most one ability charge during each night (in addition to potentially the factional kill). In addition, each night, each mafia team may increase the power of one PR category by one; this effect may be cumulative across both mafia factions, and this power increase is unblockable as it is considered an action done by the mafia team, rather than being attributable to a particular player.<br>
<b>S.8.</b> Mafia are informed what power level of each PR category town achieved at the end of each night.<br>
<b>S.9.</b> If two roleblockers target each other, their roleblocks cancel and neither takes effect. This also applies to any roleblocking cycle.<br>
<b>S.10.</b> A roleblocker is said to prevent an action from initiating; thus a roleblocked target appears to a tracker to have gone nowhere; a motion detector still detects motion from the roleblocker (unless the motion detector is themselves interfered with).<br>
<b>S.11.</b> A delayed kill cannot be roleblocked, but it can be protected from a doctor or toxic doctor (assuming the target has not accumulated toxins).<br>
<b>S.12.</b> Townies whose actions are roleblocked still count towards the overall power level of an action for that particular night.<br>
<b>S.13.</b> In scenarios where a Tracker's target has submitted actions to multiple targets, which is only possible when the target is Mafia or Werewolf who submits a kill and another night action, the Tracker only receives the kill target.</div><br>

welcome to the 2023 mafia awards voting thread!<br>
<br>
(credits to ad’s 2022 post, which credits Euler's 2021 post, which cites apw's post from 2020 Mafia Awards, whatshisbucket, and hdgehrke, as well as nd who compiled the information about the games)<br>
<br>
<b>How the voting system works:</b><br>
<br>
[quote=ad’s Voting Rules]Voting will have two stages: nomination and voting.<br>
<br>
In the nomination stage, each voter may nominate up to 3 choices for each category. Each choice that receives at least 2 votes will become an option in the voting stage. You may nominate yourself. If there are fewer than three choices that recieved at least 2 votes, any choices that recieved just 1 vote will be added as well.<br>
<br>
The voting stage will utilize a Point Voting system to determine a top three. During this stage, you may PM me an ordered list for all nominated choices you would like to vote for in each category. The last choice will recieve one point, the penultimate choice 2 points, etc. These point totals will be summated, and the choice with the most points will win. If applicable, the number of nominations will be used as a tiebreaker<br>
<br>
To vote in the nomination stage: make a single post in this thread containing your nominations for all of the events you desire. You may edit your post up to 1 day before the deadline <b>to add nominations only</b>, and you still cannot exceed the limit of 3. If you do so, please note in your edit what you have added. If you make more than one post in this thread at this time, fdas will angrily delete all of your posts and your votes may be invalidated. [/quote]<br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>

[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>

<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 2, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[list][*]All times will be in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT, UTC-7), unless otherwise noted.<br>
[*]Each day phase will be 288 hours (12 days), and each night phase will be 48 hours (2 days).<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, contact the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">This game is based on the <a href="http://bit.ly/m6msw" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">Matrix6</a> setup. This is a semi-open setup.<br>
<br>
In this setup, there are 9 players. Before the game starts, the setup will be randomly chosen from 6 possible role combinations:<br>
[list][*]<b>Setup 1:</b> 1 Town Jailkeeper, 6 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons<br>
[*]<b>Setup 2:</b> 1 Town Cop, 1 Town Doctor, 5 Vanilla Townies, 1 Mafia Roleblocker, 1 Mafia Goon<br>
[*]<b>Setup 3:</b> 1 Town Tracker, 1 1-shot Bulletproof Townie, 5 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons<br>
[*]<b>Setup 4/A:</b> 1 Town Jailkeeper, 1 1-shot Bulletproof Townie, 5 Vanilla Townies, 1 Mafia Roleblocker, 1 Mafia Goon<br>
[*]<b>Setup 5/B:</b> 1 Town Cop, 6 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons<br>
[*]<b>Setup 6/C:</b> 1 Town Doctor, 1 Town Tracker, 5 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons[/list]<br>
Other important setup mechanics:<br>
[list][*]This game uses Dawn start. Once all the players confirm by completing the confirm task, Dawn will end, Day 1 will start, and the EOD deadline will be 12 days from then.<br>
[*]Doctors cannot protect themselves two nights in a row.<br>
[*]A Mafia Roleblocker's action takes precedence over a Town Jailkeeper's action.<br>
[*]A Mafia Roleblocker can kill and roleblock on the same night.<br>
[*]Cop results are sane.<br>
[*]Trackers can differentiate between "No movement" and "No result."<br>
[*]Mafia have daychat.<br>
[*]Mafia factional kills (NKs) are not compulsive. [/list]<br>

Hello ERROR<br>
<br>
You are Ella (Vanilla Townie)<br>
<br>
Before coming on the train you... that's odd. You can't remember. You've always been here, with your friends, and while you can still feel them here you can't see them anyways. These new people seem nice, but a couple of them remind you of your more unkind friends. But you've survived their bullying &amp; surely you'll live through this. Though you do miss your friends. And there's been weird things going on. Your stuff got moved around. You'll keep them safe at all costs. I would wish you good luck, but it seems your Fate cannot be changed in the same way as the others.<br>
<br>
Your power lies in your observation skills, your voice, and your vote. You may NOT claim your flavor.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello ERROR<br>
<br>
You are Luke (Mafia Goon)<br>
<br>
God. What a bunch of weaklings. Too busy caring for each other to do anything useful. Whatever, more power for you, and after all nobody could do anything better than you. It's only a matter of time before they start disrupting your perfect system though. This train is so slow too, you desperately wish you could be in a car, though you've never been outside of this train. You once told another passenger and they looked annoyed. They're going to get you for that. I mean they're probably rifling through your belongings at this very moment looking for something incriminating. That's it. You have to get everybody who's not on your side off of the train. And you don't care if you leave while doing it because of the better future it will create, which is a good thing too since the omens have not been looking good recently.<br>
<br>
Your partners devised a communication system so that you can talk with your allies at any time. During the night, you also collectively eliminate one other player from the train.<br>
<br>
You win when all Town are killed, or nothing can prevent this outcome.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Jailkeeper<br>
<br>
Whenever any feuds get too intense you always break them up. It deeply pains you to do so, but you've long learned that the best strategy is to isolate one of the parties completely. After many iterations, your friends made a lock that's unbreakable from either side but you're the only one they trust to be able to use it. You've come close to unlocking it early several times, but couldn't bear the thought of breaking everyone's trust.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will both prevent them from taking any actions and stop them from being killed by the mafia night kill.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The 1-Shot BP<br>
<br>
You trust everybody else on the train as much as everyone, but you can't get over the nagging fear that somebody's going to come in to your room and kill you. That's kind of odd, since this is a train, not to mention how close everybody is, but it helps you sleep at night. With a bit of help you made a system that, once it detects somebody's trying to kill you, will raise walls around your bed. But you couldn't ever make it re-usable, but you'd always make another if you needed to. Though in the many years you've been on the train nothing's happened.<br>
<br>
The first time you are targeted by a mafia night kill, you will survive.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Cop<br>
<br>
Whenever you're doing something with your friends you always bring along a book. Not because the conversations are boring but because the books are so interesting. You're mostly on a non-fiction kick these days. As a result you've become the go-to friend not only for any existing knowledge but for finding out anything. Especially about other people. Evil always leaves a paper trail, and you can follow it like no other.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will be informed of their alignment: either Town or Mafia.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Tracker<br>
<br>
You've always been eerily quiet, to the point where if somebody isn't looking at you they won't know you're there. And you've gotten pretty good at hiding yourself too. Whenever the occasional new face joins the train you always watch out to see where they're going. However you do get a little bit too focused and wouldn't even notice if someone punched them in the face, so long as they didn't punch back.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will be informed of who, if anybody, they visit during that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Doctor<br>
<br>
You've wanted absolutely nothing more than to be able to protect your friends, and after several years of hard training you've finally been able to do it. You've been able to help the group get through the occasional rough patch, but you can only hope that you're able to help this new group of passengers. You value nothing more than life itself, and even one more day of life extended is a miracle you could never have expected.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and protect them from the mafia night kill.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Mafia Roleblocker<br>
<br>
Luke always told you stories of a time when the train was much more quiet, and after that you've always been trying to restore that ideal. You tried just staying in your room, but not only would people keep dragging you out, it was still loud anyways. So then you tried going outside during the night, but someone always eventually went outside. So you tried to mitigate this by copying the blueprints The Jailkeeper uses for his locks, and while that helped, it was still too loud during the day. So you resolved to get everyone who wouldn't be quiet off the train.<br>
<br>
Your partners devised a communication system so that you can talk with your allies at any time. During the night, you also collectively eliminate one other player from the train.<br>
Furthermore, you can target any player and prevent them from taking any actions that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all Town are killed, or nothing can prevent this outcome.</div></div><br>

[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/code]</span><br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: Thornclaw9000[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes placed in hide tags or quotes will be ignored.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day strictly more than 1/2 of the votes, rounded down, are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day greater than 1/2 of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.<br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">This game will use the <a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Bastard%2B%2B" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">Bastard++</a> setup. This is a semi-open setup. Please look at the link for more information about the setup, but note that some of the role names may have been altered.<br>
[list]<br>
[*] There are 13 players.<br>
[*] This setup uses a Daystart.<br>
[*] Rolecops/Stalkers are guaranteed to be sane.<br>
[*] Doctors prevent one nightkill.<br>
[*] Nightkills are indistinguishable. There is no difference between a Mafia, Serial Killer, or Vigilante kill.<br>
[*] Normal hang majority is strictly greater than 1/2 of all living players, Cult win majority is strictly greater than 1/2 of all living players.<br>
[*] The role modifier "Hated" means that 1 less vote is required for hang majority.<br>
[*] The role modifier "Loved" is the opposite of "Hated", meaning that one more vote is required for hang majority.<br>
[*] The role modifier "Bulletproof" prevents 1 night-kill per night.<br>
[*] The role modifier "Weak" means that if the person targets a mafia for their night-action, they die.<br>
[*] If the role modifier "1-Shot" is added, depending on what is connected to it allows an ability to be used only once.<br>
[*] The moderator will not purposefully present incorrect information, and role modifier(s) (if any) will show in Role PMs and on flip. The only exception to this is the “Hidden Condemnee” role modifier, which will not show in Role PMs, but will show on flip.<br>
[*] This rule is applicable to only Jester, Survivor, and Mafia Goon. Actual roles may have different flavor names than the examples in the Role PMs tab. Example flavornames are not necessarily used, even if the role has one or two instances in the game. Additionally, there may be multiple instances of the same flavorname for these roles.<br>
[*] Each player will have a personal Vanilla Townie flavorname and flavor, regardless of actual role.<br>
[*] If the randomization of the setup results in an impossible setup, then it will be reranded. Examples include but are not limited to "CCCCCCJTSK" (no corresponding result for 6 Cs) and "CJJJSSSSK" (1+3+5+3+1+3 = 16 unique roles which is greater than the number of players in the setup, 13)<br>

[*] Jester and Condemner do not end the game if they win. Condemner will leave the game once their condemnee has died in any way.<br>
[*] Refrain from angleshooting, especially about flavor.<br>
[*] Note that the Role PMs tab lacks flavor due to laziness. Each player will have a personal Vanilla Townie flavorname and I can create flavor for it if requested. (i am very lazy!) I might end up writing flavor for them anyways throughout the game if I have the time.<br>

Gensokyo hadn't had an incident in almost a month, when Yukari Yakumo suddenly went missing. While this wouldn't normally be of concern, a massive gap appearing, the Great Hakurei Barrier weakening, and the spell card rules vanishing have led to great concern. The massive gap mysteriously had text spelled out -  "Yukari Yakumo". Reimu threw a rock in to investigate, and the text suddenly changed to spell "Rock". The shrine maidens, people, and youkai quickly realized that Yukari is very likely dead, whoever killed Yukari was a threat, and the power balance and lives of Gensokyo may be in danger. Every clue was pointing to the Scarlet Devil Mansion being behind all of this.<br>
<br>
Thornclaw9000 (Yukari Yakumo) is dead. Day 1 begins.</div><br>

<br>
<b>Important Rules:<br>
Do not edit or delete posts<br>
Do not post during night<br>
Do not post if you are dead or if you are not in the game<br>
Do not talk about anything related to this game outside this thread<br>
Read all the rules!<br>

<br>
<b>Rules</b><br>
[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]<b>1.1:</b> Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.2:</b> Do not post at night.<br>
[*]<b>1.3:</b> You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]<b>1.4:</b> Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]<b>1.5:</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes size=1, hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others. This does not include adding extra spaces.<br>
[*]<b>1.6:</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.7:</b> If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]<b>1.8:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]<b>1.9:</b> Do not use the colors red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), green (#00FF00), or anything that appears similar, as these colors are used for modding purposes.<br>
[*]<b>1.10:</b> Confirm your participation in the game by making a post stating the important rules[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Hanging</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format [code][code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/‎code][/code]<br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

[*] <b>3.9:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving an in-game prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.10:</b> If a player does not post in another 48-hour period after receiving a PM prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>

It's 12:02 AM. You are exhausted from an incredibly busy day and are ready to zone out for the night. While scrolling through your notification center before you sleep, you pass by a green, smiling face of an owl.<br>
<br>
Your finger stops scrolling. Your heart skips a beat. You slowly scroll back up, heart now pounding, fingers shaking. There it is. The message you've been dreading for decades.<br>
<br>
<b>It looks like you haven't done your lesson yet. You know what that means!</b><br>

<br>

[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: DXtreme</b> and <b>Vote: dXtReMe</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: DXtreme</b>, <b>Vote: Dx</b>, <b>Vote: DXtreme.</b>, <b>Vote:DXtreme</b>, Vote: <b>DXtreme</b>, and <b><i>Vote: DXtreme</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts (VCs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC anytime in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>

Phew, you are actually a berry! Grapes are a simple fruit, liked by everyone, but there is nothing special about you. It is your goal to bring change to how the garden defines berries.<br>

You have no other power other than your voice and vote.<br>

[quote]You are a cranberry (Cop).<br>
<br>
You paid attention in third grade when you learned about fruits and berries, and even kept your worksheet about it. You float to the top for a reason. Armed with this knowledge, you are able to determine whether a plant produces berries or not.<br>
<br>
Every night, you may target one person and determine their alignment.<br>

[quote]You are an elderberry (Doctor).<br>
<br>
Elderberries are known for their healing properties. Used in teas, pills, creams, and candies, this natural supplement is known to boost the immune system and lessen cold symptoms. If you give another plant some of your berries, they will be able to withstand Roundup for the night.<br>
<br>
Every night you may heal someone, allowing them to survive if they would have otherwise died. You may not heal yourself two nights in a row.<br>

[quote]You are a  blueberry (Tracker).<br>
<br>
Everyone lovvvves blueberries. But they make a bit of a mess when eaten. When someone eats your fruit, sticky purple fingerprints will be left wherever they go.<br>

[quote]You are a watermelon (Jailkeeper).<br>
<br>
You are one of the biggest, sturdiest fruits in the garden. Your thick rind can protect other plants while also preventing them from causing any mischief.<br>
<br>
Each night you may choose someone to put in jail. That person will be unable to perform any actions that night and night kills attempting to target that person will be blocked.<br>

[quote]You are a banana (1-Shot Bulletproof Townie).<br>
<br>
As a wise person once said, “[Bananas] have layers”. Your thick, inedible peel protects you from harm.<br>
<br>
On the first time that you are attacked by the Mafia, that kill will be negated.<br>

[quote]You are a strawberry (Mafia Goon).<br>
<br>
You are shocked to learn that you are not, in fact, a berry! Your view of the garden, of life, and of your own self-worth is shattered. The culinary definition of a berry has worked for all these years, why should it change now! Oh, and, you have access to the gardener’s shed, where you can obtain Roundup (hehe).<br>
<br>
You may talk with your partner () here. Every night you or your partner may use Roundup on one plant, killing them.<br>

<br>
[quote]You are a blackberry (Mafia Roleblocker).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you are only a berry by the culinary definition. You hope to uphold this definition in the garden and maintain your status. Blackberries are tasty but they contain a lot of seeds. Every night, you may give blackberries to another plant, and they will be unable to do anything but pick seeds out of their teeth for the rest of the night. Oh, and, you have access to the gardener’s shed, where you can obtain Roundup (hehe).<br>
<br>
You may talk with your partner () here. Every night you or your partner may use Roundup on one plant, killing them. You may also target someone, and that person will be unable to perform any actions that night. Your ability takes precedence over the jailkeeper.<br>

[*]Post votes in bold font in the format "<b>Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;</b>", or c or code text: [code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/code].<br>
[*]Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*]You may vote for no elimination to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post "<b>Vote: No Elimination</b>" or: [code]Vote: No Elimination[/code].<br>
[*]You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though you have the ability to do so. Unvote in the format "<b>Vote: Unvote</b>" or: [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]. An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*]If the deadline is met the player with the most votes is eliminated. If there is a tie, the player who received the votes first is eliminated. If No Elimination is part of the tie, No Elimination occurs.<br>
[*]Starting day 2, If more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be eliminated. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*]Starting day 2, If at least half of the votes are for no elimination, then there will be no elimination. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline passes, it will be twilight and no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*]During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Story</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">Dock was a small village in the province of pi on the west coast of an island. The small village had seemingly remained unaffected by the mafia, but that was not to say they weren't lurking about. A boat sunk not far off the coast, and the passengers managed to swim to shore, with many taking refuge in the village. The sudden influx of visitors and people trying to move in put the village of Dock into high alert.<br>
<br>
This village has been believed to be a key target for the mafia for a while, as if they could control and stop the imports to the island it would be that much easier to control the entire island. Suspectum Industries upper management responded to the theory with something along the lines of "Yeah, sure, that makes sense. We'll get on it right away." To which they had not yet gotten on it, whatever that may mean, leaving the Dock Village to fend for itself.<br>
<br>
With the village having the port onto and off of the island, it became known as the Trading Village, as it was the prime spot to trade gems and other goods for tools and other equipment. Someone would always trade their tool for the most valuable gem offered, although people tended to be a bit biased as to the worth of the gem in their own possession.</div><br>

[quote=Example Town Trader Role PM]Welcome NDMath to <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c49h3225274p29525152" class="bbcode_url">Mafia Game 279</a><br>
<br>
You are a Town Trader.<br>
<br>
Each night, you may target a player to attempt to trade roles with them. This exchange will occur at the end of the night, after the player being traded with would have used their night action if they have one. Your trade attempt fails if you die the same night, but you can trade with a dying player (causing them to flip as your Trader role). Attempting to trade with someone who started the night as a Trader also fails. If two traders attempt to trade with the same target, only the trader with the smaller hidden priority number will succeed.<br>
<br>
You win when all mafia members are dead.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Each Trader has a unique priority number from 1 to N, Town never has access to these priority numbers but mafia learn the priority number of Trader roles they possess and of those that die.</div><br>

[*]<b>1.8:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>

[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format [code][code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/‎code][/code]<br>

[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>

[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

[*] <b>3.10:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving a PM prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>

Five Mafia vs. seven Town<br>
<br>
If the town successfully eliminates a Mafia player on a particular day, then the Mafia team kills a Town player that night. However, if the town eliminates incorrectly, then the Mafia team has to sacrifice one of their own the following night.<br>
<br>
Town wins if they eliminate three mafia goons before they eliminate town three times.<br>
<br>
Mafia wins if they eliminate town three times before three of their members are eliminated.<br>
<br>
If there's no majority at deadline, there's no elimination.<br>
<br>
If this happens once, the Mafia will be required to No-Kill on the following night.<br>
<br>
If this happens again, then the Mafia will get to make a Kill the following night.</div><br>

After signing up, each player should privately message me a list of 3 roles from one of the games I had moderated in the past with no more than one role from the same game. One of these roles will be selected to be in the game, but role distribution is randomized. The role's power and wincon may be modified in order to allow it to properly fit into the game.<br>
<br>
Vote modifying roles may exist in the game. Alignment changing roles may exist in the game. Certain players may be provided with mock role PMs for fakeclaim purposes.<br>

They were a motley group, coming from a diverse set of universes. Above them, fdas sat on a overhanging balcony and clapped.<br>
<br>
"Good, you're all here," he said. "You all know what its time for now."<br>
<br>
"Not another one of these. I died last time," one said.<br>
<br>
"I didn't die," another said, chuckling.<br>
<br>
"Well lucky you. You'll be the first one dying this time then."<br>
<br>
"We'll see about that."<br>
<br>
"Well hopefully I don't die because of a bunch of idiots this time. Can any of you, like, think for once."<br>
<br>
"That's enough," fdas said. "Not all of you may want to be here, but you're here now. And there's no escape. Now, let me explain the rules this time."<br>
<br>
"It doesn't matter who you all were in your past life. You could have been an ordinary person, a crazy criminal, a god, or a professional jobber. Your past affiliations no longer matter. All that remains is the color you will receive. Yes, all of you will receive a color denoting what team you are on in this game."<br>
<br>
"The Green Teamwill be the most numerous one. However, you will also be the least well informed. Your enemies will be the Red Team, Brown Team, and Purple Team. Do be aware that not everyone of the same color will necessarily have the same goals in this game."<br>
<br>
"There are three things you will need in order to be successful in this game. An open mind able to consider all possibilities, an intelligent mind able to determine the implications of each possibility, and a sound mind unswayed by biases and emotion. But last of all, Good Luck."<br>
<br>
With that said, fdas vanished and the participants were left to fend for themselves.</div><br>

				This is the 2023 Mafia Awards discussion thread, (better late than never? maybe)<br>
<br>
Discuss the 2023 Mafia Awards in this thread, (not in the nominations thread once it's created). Planned schedule is for Nominations thread to open on the 11th, nominations to close on the 25th and for voting to finish on the 3rd. Players that were around for most or all of 2023 are encouraged to make nominations.<br>
<br>
Eligible mafia games are those that finished between January 1st 2023, and December 31st 2023, and Game 277 since I don't want to be forced to analyze it again in eleven months.<br>
This means the eligible games are mafia game 260, and 262-277.<br>

				Welcome to Mafia Game 276<br>
<br>
<b>Important Rules:<br>
Do not edit or delete posts<br>
Do not post during night<br>
Do not post if you are dead or if you are not in the game<br>
Do not talk about anything related to this game outside this thread<br>
Read all the rules!<br>
</b><br>
<br>
<b>Rules</b><br>
[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]<b>1.1:</b> Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.2:</b> Do not post at night.<br>
[*]<b>1.3:</b> You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]<b>1.4:</b> Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]<b>1.5:</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes size=1, hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others. This does not include adding extra spaces.<br>
[*]<b>1.6:</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.7:</b> If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]<b>1.8:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]<b>1.9:</b> Do not use the colors red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), green (#00FF00), or anything that appears similar, as these colors are used for modding purposes.<br>
[*]<b>1.10:</b> Confirm your participation in the game by making a post stating the important rules[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Hanging</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format [code][code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/‎code][/code]<br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

[*] <b>3.9:</b> If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving an in-game prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*] <b>3.10:</b> If a player does not post in another 48-hour period after receiving a PM prod and he/she is not in V/LA, he/she will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>

[list][*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Rules</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]Read the rules. All of them. Read them multiple times if necessary.<br>
[*]Do not post at night.<br>
[*]You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from me, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]Day chat will be enabled via an AoPS private forum.<br>
[*]You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]When the game starts respond to your role pm with a message in the town flavor color (#f60).<br>
[*]Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]Do not imitate the mods.[/list]</div><br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Voting/Hanging</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]This game will partially use the voting rules philosophy of "if it looks like a vote, it's a vote". So spelling/capitalization does not matter so long as the “Vote:” part is right, and the following two rules are met.<br>
[*]Post votes in bold font in the format "<b>Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;</b>", or c or code text: [code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/code].<br>
[*]Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*]You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post "<b>Vote: No Hang</b>" or: [code]Vote: No Hang[/code].<br>
[*]You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though you have the ability to do so. Unvote in the format "<b>Vote: Unvote</b>" or: [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]. An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*]If the deadline is met the player with the most votes is hanged. If there is a tie the player who received the votes first is hanged. If No Hang is part of the tie, No Hang occurs.<br>
[*]Starting day 1, If more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*]Starting day 1, If at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline passes, it will be twilight and no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*]During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*]Once I (or the comod) post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*] <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Activity</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">[list]<br>
[*]Each day will be 240 hours (10 days). The moderator may extend the deadline for the end of the day at his/her discretion.<br>
[*]The deadline will occur the very second 240 hours has occurred.<br>
[*]The night deadline will be 48 hours after night begins.<br>
[*]When the night deadline is met, if the moderator does not receive a night action from either a player or his/her partner(s) (if you have them), the player will lose the chance to perform an action during that night.<br>
[*]Night will end at some time after the night deadline when the mod makes the post announcing the end of night.<br>
[*]If a player does not post in a 48-hour period and they are not in V/LA, you will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*]If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving a PM prod and they are not in V/LA, they will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player is going to be V/LA, they must PM me. The moderator will not prod the player unless the V/LA is too long.[list]</div><br>

[*]Don't intentionally/purposely gamethrow. If you believe you can no longer win talk to me in your role pm.<br>
[*]For a minor rule infraction, players can receive up to two warnings. If a player commits an infraction after they have run out of warnings, or commits a modkill level infraction, they may be modkilled or force replaced. Please do not make me modkill you.[/list]</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Story</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">A boat was approaching the&nbsp;eastside of the island. And this was a good thing since this was in fact the island the passengers were trying to get to. But this wasn't a perfect thing, for the passengers wanted to arrive on the westside, as that was the inhabited part, and traveling around the island was going to leave them quite vulnerable.<br>
<br>
The Water God patrolled the eastern coast of the island. They were rather mysterious and liked the isolation. The Water God is patient and could destroy anything, given enough time. This particular boat could easily be defeated with a single whirlpool, but it would be far more joyful to the Water God to sink the boat at what would like the last possible moment for things to go wrong to the passengers. After all, it's not every day that a boat comes passing through these waters.<br>
<br>
The Fire God recently took home to the eastern side of the island because of the dense forest. The Fire God was strong and active, often simply destroying whatever was in its path. Often viewed as careless but never afraid to stand up to the darkness of evil. Seeing what was at stake here, the Fire God ordered their minions to attack immediately. It may not be the wisest idea to attack water with fire, but the Fire God would not die easily either in this woodland.<br>
<br>
There were rumors among the minions that Goddess Snow would see the action going on and come interfere. What her motives were, however, was unclear.</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">The setup is closed, but there is exactly 3 mafia and at most 1 third party aligned player.<br>
Town is flavored as fire-based/aligned and Mafia is flavored as water-based/aligned.<br>
Mafia are multitasking by default.<br>
<br>
The action resolution for this game is <a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">Reasonable Action Resolution.</a><br>
Private Chats are via AoPS forum with daychat enabled.<br>
No action may self-target unless stated otherwise in the player's role pm.<br>

You are a Fire Minion.<br>

As a minion, you have no special abilities, but that could change!<br>

You win when all water-aligned players are dead.[/quote]<br>

You are a Water Minion. The town role with matching abilities is called Fire Minion, however this does not confirm the existence of that role only the possibility.<br>
<br>
As a minion, you have no special abilities, but that could change!<br>
You may also submit your team's factional kill each night, and have access to a private factional chat.<br>

<br>
<br>
[center]The ghost town where you have been sent finally comes into focus in the dry, dusty Iowa air. Three hours from anywhere significant, this is where the journey is taking place.<br>
<br>
You turn onto a gravel road, winding through endless fields of wheat and corn. Finally you stop at a large house with many cars parked outside of it. The house looks like it was built in the 1990s, almost sixty years ago, in stark contrast to the fancy cars parked all around.<br>
<br>
You park your car and walk into the house. You are greeted by a pair of two physicists whose names you know.<br>
<br>
"Hey, glad you made it," Vernon Barton exclaims, slapping your back.<br>
<br>
"We're excited to have you here," Erick Fischer adds, settling for a nice handshake.<br>
<br>
"Alright," Vernon says, "Let's head back and meet the others."[/center]<br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 2, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

<br>
<br>
[list][*]All times will be in Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) as applicable, unless otherwise noted.<br>
[*]Each day phase will be 264 hours (11 days), and each night phase will be 72 hours (3 days).<br>
[*]The deadline may be extended or reduced by one hour due to the beginning or end of Daylight Savings Time. Players will be told if this happens.<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

[*]Be mature and use common sense.<br>
[*]Behavior that disrupts the game for players and makes it unreasonably hard for them to read and play may result in a warning.<br>
<b>Causing significant disruptions to gameplay may result in a force replacement at the moderators' discretion.<br>
[*]For minor rule infractions, first-timers can receive up to three warnings, while all other players can receive up to two. A player may receive multiple warnings for a single infraction.[/list]<br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">This is a 17-player closed setup. There are 13 town-aligned players and 4 mafia-aligned players. All players begin as vanilla roles, and powers are granted each night through an undisclosed process. There are 17 powers in the game, and with the death of a player, their power will be removed from the game.<br>
<br>
At the end of a night, after night actions have been processed, the powers will be changed. A player may receive the same power two nights in a row. Nothing related to power-changing is based on alignment.<br>
<br>
Mafias will be provided with fake town PMs for their character. The flavor was written before alignments were determined, so do not attempt to use PM flavor to deduce alignment.<br>

Hello [username], and welcome to Mafia Game 274. You are <b>Alma McDowell (Townie)</b>.<br>

As a professional scientist, you are obsessed with the unknown. You view life as one great adventure, and the exploration of the quantum realm is one more chapter in that adventure. You would love to return from a journey such as this and teach the world about your findings.<br>

You win when all threats to town are eliminated. Good luck.[/quote]<br>

Hello [username], and welcome to Mafia Game 274. You are <b>Jared Ritter (Mafia)</b>.<br>

As a professional scientist, you are happy with the state of the world right now. You have developed a theory of the universe that is not consistent with many of the observations in the quantum realm, and to see your theory destroyed would be catastrophic to your reputation.

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players after the minimum deadline has elapsed, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[list][*]All times will be in Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) as applicable, unless otherwise noted.<br>
[*]Each day phase will be 168 hours (7 days), and each night phase will be 48 hours (2 days).<br>
[*]Players are required to post at a minimum of 5 times each 48 hours. These posts must be game-advancing and NOT fillers. This will be moderated harshly.<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs), Votecounts (VCs), and Postcounts (PCs) will be posted periodically, typically once in 24 hours. Players may request a new AC or VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>

[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

				[center]Welcome to Mafia Game 270<br>
<b>UIC Invitational VIII</b><br>
<br>
IMAGE[/center]<br>
<br>
For thousands of years, unseen angels guided humanity through some of their worst crises, artificial or otherwise, attempting to help them into a brighter future. Two centuries ago, however, the angelic community was crippled as one of the biggest companies in the morality consultation business succumbed to demonic sabotage and fell. (Like, literally, from the sky.) In the years since, they scattered to the four corners of the earth as financial mismanagement in both the human and angelic worlds created a devastating recession.<br>
<br>
Yet even in these trying and unprecedented times, some still dreamed of a return to the golden age of angelic capitalism. Quietly, they began to search for the hidden vaults where bygone corporations had stowed billions, maybe even trillions of dollars, all of them lost to time...<br>

<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players after the minimum deadline has elapsed, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

<br>
<br>
[list][*]All times will be in Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) as applicable, unless otherwise noted.<br>
[*]Each day phase will be 240 hours (10 days), and each night phase will be 48 hours (2 days).<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

Hello, [player]!<br>
<br>
You are an <b>Currently Unpaid, Will Continue to be Unpaid Angel (Vanilla Townie)</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>As a blue-linen, working class angel, this recession has hit you particularly hard. You long for the simple joys of minimum wage employment like the threadbare healthcare benefits, micromanaging managers, and that promotion that you’re definitely gonna get SoonTM. Although you proclaim your corporate enthusiasm, you still like your Jinnstagram memes with a side of anti-capitalism and your favorite sport is watching labor unions slug it out with HR on livestream. Most importantly, you know when capitalism’s gone too far. </i><br>
<br>
Your power lies in your observation skills, your voice, and your vote.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>

Hello, [player]!<br>
<br>
You are the <b>Golden Child (Town JOAT)</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>The absolute, perfect, quintessential unpaid intern. On time, smart, responsible, omnipresent and omni-knowledgeable, you show up in every (attempting to be an) adult’s, “Oh man, when I grow up, I want to be as good as [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE].” You’re skilled, you’re popular, you’ve achieved fun-life-work balance, and everyone knows your name— Actually, no, everyone knows Scipio1 was the original golden child, but um. So sorry. Ah, this is so awkward, but um. Which one are you again? </i><br>
<br>
Each night, you may choose to use one of the following three abilities:<br>
[list][*]Check the alignment of a player (1-shot Cop)<br>
[*]Protect a player from the mafia factional kill (1-shot Doctor)<br>
[*]Shoot a player during the night (1-shot Vigilante)[/list]<br>
Once you have used up all your abilities, you will no longer have access to any night actions. [/list]<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>

Your partner is <b>[player] ([role])</b>, and you may discuss with them in <a href="http://bit.ly/MafQT" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">this private forum</a> while you are alive. The two of you will be able to choose a player to kill each night, as well as decide who makes the kill.<br>

Substitutions: Noting that a player X has subbed for player Y is fine. Noting when that occurred is fine. Discussing why someone has been subbed out, announcing you will sub out, telling someone to sub out, public speculation as to someone's alignment based on the substitution itself, all forbidden. Think what you will about this person's alignment, at your own risk. But using the substitution as reasoning is disallowed. It's bad for the game.<br>
<br>
To be clear, you can talk about the player who was subbed out. You can say that they were subbed out. You can say when they subbed out. You can say why the player that subbed out was scummy based on what they did or didn't do while they were a player. All that's being (not) discussed here is speculation as to why they subbed out. That's all the rule forbids. If you can be careful and stick to the legal stuff, you'll be fine. It's a very limited rule. The word "sub" is not lava, you can touch it. You don't get penalized for saying that a player was subbed in or out. Just don't discuss why they were subbed out. The "why" is what is ruled out. Think what you will, speculate internally. Just remember, the part that is illegal is "why they subbed out." It's not part of the game.[/quote]</div><br>

[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled<strike>, but not necessarily capitalized,</strike> correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]<strike>For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.</strike><br>
[*]<strike>For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.</strike> Ignore this.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b> or <b>Vote: Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes that appear real may or may not be counted.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 2, if a player is voted by the majority of living players and the minimum deadline has passed, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline passes, no further votes will be counted. For example, if the deadline is at 9:00 PM, votes timestamped 9:00 PM will be counted, but votes timestamped 9:01 PM will not. <strike>Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.</strike><br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

<br>
<b>Basic Info</b><br>
- 21er: 16 Vanilla Townies, 5 Mafia Goons. (Abilities come from auction items.)<br>
- Town win when all Mafia are eliminated. Mafia win upon reaching parity, or when nothing can prevent this.<br>
- Mafia have a mandatory, assigned factional nightkill. This may be used on the same player multiple nights in a row.<br>
<br>
<b>Auction Mechanics</b><br>
- Players start with 10 coins.<br>
- An auction phase occurs after each day. A list of items up for auction is posted, and players may submit private bids on these items.<br>
- Players may bid a positive integer number of coins on any number of items, provided their total bids for an auction do not exceed their number of coins.<br>
- The highest bid wins each item (random if tied). Only the winners pay coins.<br>
- After the auction phase, the game moves into the night phase, where night actions can be used.<br>
- There is also an auction phase before the first day phase.<br>
- Thus, the game progresses as follows:<br>
Auction 0,<br>
Day 1, Auction 1, Night 1,<br>
Day 2, Auction 2, Night 2,<br>
etc.<br>
- Day/auction/night phase lengths: 10 days / 2 days / 2 days.<br>
- Auctions will end after night 5.<br>
- Bids, item winners, and item uses are not publicly revealed (though naturally, it will be sometimes be obvious when an item is used). Players may claim them freely and lie about them.<br>
<br>
<b>Items</b><br>
- Items are generally limited shot actions, with some other things sprinkled in.<br>
- Unless otherwise specified, actions from items are usable during the night phase only.<br>
- Items that are actions do not have to be used immediately. Items, especially ones that interact with other items/actions, can often be more impactful if used later in the game. Of course, saving an item for later comes with the risk that you'll die before using it.<br>
- Items will generally become more powerful as the game goes on, but the number of items offered each auction will taper off.<br>
<br>
<b>Bank</b><br>
- Mafia have access to a bank, which starts with a balance of 0 coins.<br>
- After a Mafia dies, 60% of their remaining coins (minus any they withdrew from the bank) are added to the bank balance.<br>
- After a Town dies, 20% of their remaining coins are subtracted from the bank balance.<br>
- Mafia members may withdraw an integer number of coins from the bank during auctions, provided the bank balance does not become negative.<br>
- The bank balance can go negative due to town deaths (which has no effect other than preventing withdrawal) or hold a non-integer number of coins.<br>
<br>
<b>Other Details</b><br>
- This game is not bastard, though elements that might be considered borderline bastard may exist.<br>
- For example, there may be nonstandard roles (such as redirectors) that may mess with your actions - for this game's purposes, anything influenced by said roles will not be considered as lying. It is guaranteed, however, that Framers, Godfather, Millers, or other roles of that sort do not exist, nor are there alignment conversion or any borderline bastard mechanics of that sort.<br>
- Any investigative abilities will show their target(s) in their results.<br>
- Unless otherwise specified, players are by default multitasking and non self-targeting.<br>
- Actions will be processed in accordance with <a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">Reasonable Action Resolution</a>.<br>
- When a player dies, only their role is revealed. Their bids, items, remaining coins, etc. are not.<br>
- Do not quote or pretend to quote your role PM or any private mod communication. You may claim your bids, actions, results, etc. - just don't directly quote a sentence from the mod, paraphrase instead.<br>
- Do not reference or pretend to reference private communication with the mod unless it is mechanical information (e.g., night action results).<br>

[*]<b>1.3:</b> You may PM me at any time and ask me anything, such as rule clarification.<br>
[*]<b>1.4:</b> Do not talk about this game outside of this topic to anyone other than the mods in charge, unless I specifically allow you to do so.<br>
[*]<b>1.5:</b> You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes size=1, hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others. This does not include adding extra spaces.<br>
[*]<b>1.6:</b> Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>
[*]<b>1.7:</b> If you are not a living participant of the game, do not post anything else about the game anywhere. You may still spectate the game, but you may no longer post in this thread.<br>
[*]<b>1.8:</b> Do not advocate for breaking the rules.<br>
[*]<b>1.9:</b> Do not use the colors red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), green (#00FF00), or anything that appears similar, as these colors are used for modding purposes.<br>

[*] <b>2.1:</b> Post votes in code tags in the format [code][code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/‎code][/code]<br>
Since AoPS does not distinguish between usernames with different capitalizations, the capitalization of the player name does not matter. A proper vote looks like [code]Vote: fdas[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.2:</b> Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*] <b>2.3:</b> Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*] <b>2.4:</b> You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post [code]Vote: No Hang[/code]<br>
[*] <b>2.5:</b> You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though it is appreciated if you do so. Unvote in the format [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]<br>
An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*] <b>2.6:</b> Spell the username of the player you wish to vote for exactly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*] <b>2.7:</b> If at any point in a day more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.8:</b> If at any point in a day at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.9:</b> If the deadline is met and no person is hanged, it will be considered no hang and will proceed to be twilight.<br>
[*] <b>2.10:</b> The moment the deadline passes, no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*] <b>2.11:</b> During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*] <b>2.12:</b> Once I post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

Happy Town was a nice pleasant place where everyone was happy and wore a smile on their face. At least, according to the law everyone was happy, because any unhappy people were executed in order to ensure that their unhappiness would not spread and cause people to be sad. However, there were people in the town who sought to destroy this happy paradise. They have learned to keep their unhappiness concealed while going out and causing havoc by making other people unhappy. The good happy people of Happy Town knew they had to put an end to these evil unhappy people lest the happy lives of all who lived within the town be ruined.<br>

[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[*]Each day phase will be 72 hours (3 days), and each night phase will be 24 hours (1 days).<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

This is an semi-open setup, chosen to be played for the 2023 Mafia Universe Championships.<br>
<br>
In this setup, there are 15 players. There are 6 possible setups:<br>
<br>
<br>
[center]IMAGE[/center]<br>
[list][*]The Town JOAT (Jack of All Trades) has access to the following abilities: a 1-shot Doctor, a 1-shot Motion Detector, and a 1-shot Roleblock.<br>
[*]The Mafia JOAT has access to the following abilities: a 1-shot Role Cop and a 1-shot Roleblock.<br>
[*]The Town 2-shot Doctor, Town 2-shot Roleblocker, and Mafia Roleblocker cannot target the same player 2 nights in a row.<br>
[*]Doctor and jailkeeper actions cannot self-target.<br>
[*]For more specific explanations on the roles not commonly used on AoPS, please refer to the explainer post here.<br>
[*]For more details, please refer to Variance's original post <a href="https://www.mafiauniverse.com/forums/threads/38293-ADAPT6-%28Semi-open-15er%29?p=6615993&amp;viewfull=1#post6615993" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">here</a>. [/list]<br>
<br>
Other important setup mechanics:<br>
[list][*]<b>Mafia flips are redacted.</b> Upon death, their exact role will not be publicly revealed, only that they belonged to the Mafia faction. Town roles will be fully revealed on death as usual.<br>
[*]All investigative results are sane.<br>
[*]Mafia have daychat.<br>
[*]Mafia factional kills (NKs) are <b>compulsive</b>. If a target is not chosen by the Night Action deadline, a target will be randomly chosen.<br>
[*]Mentors may be assigned to the Town Cop and Mafia faction. Do not talk about mentors in the thread. [/list]<br>

<b>UIC Invitational VII</b><br>
<br>
IMAGE[/center]<br>
<br>
In a terrible dystopian future wasteland, a bunch of nerds were having a meeting in the UIC bunker.<br>
<br>
"Guys, it's been so long since we've had a Town win," Mathletesv said. "What should we do?"<br>
<br>
"Maybe I should run Matrix6, but 9v2," suggested fdas.<br>
<br>
"Maybe I should add more mentors," mused mathjay.<br>
<br>
"Just never run Cop9 again," sobbed NDMath and WisteriaV.<br>
<br>
"Guys, I have a better idea," ad333 said. "How many SE's does it take to not mess up LYLO?"<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>

[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[*]Each day phase will be 168 hours (7 days), and each night phase will be 48 hours (2 days).<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<br>
You are an <b>SE (Vanilla Townie)</b>.<br>

<i>You've heard of the terrible winningless curse haunting AoPS Mafia, and you've answered the call to save it.

[*]Day chat will be enabled via an AoPS private forum.<br>
[*]You may not use any formatting that has an effect of concealing text. This includes hide="", color=#FFFFFF, and color=white, among others.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts you have already submitted; this includes editing right after you post (what goes in the thread stays in the thread). If you for any reason find the need to change your post, use EBWOP or EBWON as necessary.<br>

[*]Post votes in bold font in the format "<b>Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;</b>", or c or code text: [code]Vote: &lt;insert player here&gt;[/code]. Type usernames exactly, although capitalization doesn’t matter so long as the “Vote:” part is capitalized right. There is one exception, l and I are treated as the same.<br>
[*]Votes may not be placed in hide tags.<br>
[*]Improperly made votes will not be counted under any circumstances. It does not matter if it is the end of the game hammer and everyone revealed their roles. Hint: don’t reveal your roles and declare victory until I made the official end of the game post.<br>
[*]You may vote for no hang to occur during a day. Vote this by including in your post "<b>Vote: No Hang</b>" or: [code]Vote: No Hang[/code].<br>
[*]You do not have to unvote before making a new vote, though you have the ability to do so. Unvote in the format "<b>Vote: Unvote</b>" or: [code]Vote: Unvote[/code]. An unvote will undo your previous vote, if any.<br>
[*]If the deadline is met the player with the most votes is hanged. If there is a tie the player who received the votes first is hanged. If No Hang is part of the tie, No Hang occurs.<br>
[*]After the 48 hour mark in a day, If more than half of the votes are for a single player, that player will be hanged. It will then immediately be twilight.<br>
[*]After the 48 hour mark in a day, If at least half of the votes are for no hang, then there will be no hang. It will then be twilight.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline passes, it will be twilight and no more votes will be counted even if the mod has not made a post.<br>
[*]During twilight, players may still post. However, no more votes and/or unvotes will be processed.<br>
[*]Once I (or the comod) post a end-of-day scene, the person hanged (if any) is officially dead. Night then immediately begins. You may not post during night.[/list]</div><br>

[*]The deadlines will be based on Central Timezone.<br>
[*]The deadline will occur the very second 240 hours has occurred.<br>
[*]The night deadline will be 48 hours after night begins.<br>
[*]When the night deadline is met, if the moderator does not receive a night action from either a player or his/her partner(s) (if you have them), the player will lose the chance to perform an action during that night.<br>
[*]Night will end at some time after the night deadline when the mod makes the post announcing the end of night.<br>
[*]If a player does not post in a 48-hour period and they are not in V/LA, you will receive a PM prod.<br>
[*]If a player does not post in another 24-hour period after receiving a PM prod and they are not in V/LA, or a player has received too many PM prods, they will be replaced, unless you post before the moderator finds a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player is going to be V/LA, they must PM me. The moderator will not prod the player unless the V/LA is too long.[list]</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Story</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">It had been a month since the debacle at Suspectum Industries. Which although did not relate to the citizens in the town across the river, they had read about it in the newspaper and thought just that, it couldn't relate. Nobody would seek to harm their town or them, that was a problem in other towns but not this one. Of course, that mindset did not last when the only Town Firefighter, WisteriaV, vanished. It was clear she had put up a fight and was likely captured somewhere.<br>
<br>
Multiple urgent problems were immediately apparent to the townspeople. Not only were a group of bad people present, they weren't just techies, and quite possibly they could be members of the mafia. And without the town's only firefighter, nobody could stop them from just lighting people's houses on fire in the night. Thirteen prominent townspeople quickly organized. They were determined to deal with the threat facing the town if it was the last thing they did.</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Setup</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">As this game is a upick, when signing up for the game, each player will have submitted a list of 3 jobs to the co-mod, WisteriaV. Alignments will be randomized, and then a setup designed so that each player gets one of their submitted jobs as their role name.<br>
<br>
This game also has a known special mechanic, income. Each player will earn a set number of coins each night as their income. During the day, extra votes for that dayphase only can be purchased for a number of coins equal to the day number. Such purchases will first be processed at the 48 hour mark of the day, and can at the latest be purchased at the 96 hour mark of the day. Extra votes adjust the threshhold for a majority, and purchases will remain anonymous until utilized. There will most likely be other, role specific, ways to interact with income.<br>
<br>
The setup is closed, but the alignment ratio is 10 town and 3 mafia.<br>
<br>
The action resolution for this game is <a href="https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Reasonable_Action_Resolution" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">Reasonable Action Resolution.</a><br>
Private Chats are via AoPS forum with daychat enabled.<br>
No action may self-target unless stated otherwise in the player's role pm.<br>
<br>
[quote=Example Role PM]Welcome WisteriaV to [url=]Mafia Game 265[/url].<br>
<br>
You are a Town Fire Fighter named Karis.<br>
<br>
Growing up, Karis saw how devastating fires could be, whether it was hillsides turned black by the flames, or the smoke causing the air quality to be so bad people wouldn’t go outside. She had always wanted to have a job that would help people, and what better way than being a firefighter? She now has had extensive training in both fighting fires and emergency response making her well prepared for dangers to the town.<br>
<br>
<b>Fire Protection:</b> Each night you may target a player to attempt to prevent any negative effects on that player.<br>
<b>Income:</b> Each night you make 1 coin in income per 4 living players at the start of the night.<br>
<br>
Confirm by responding with to this pm with your alignment. You win when all mafia are dead.[/quote]</div><br>

				[center]Welcome to Mafia Game 264<br>
<b>UIC SSG4</b><br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
It is the year 10035. With the Theom empire solidly in control of most of the continent of Pacifica, the dynasty has declared peace and prosperity everlasting. But underneath that veneer, there is unease. Dissent against the empire is punished harshly. Those with anima are taken away to be indoctrinated into the empire's army or forced to fight in the Dikhotohm. And slave trade has become blatant, with small villages disappearing entirely overnight. The Myohan in particular, as the architects and builders of the Citadel, force thousands and thousands of slaves to labor in the creation of their projects.<br>
<br>
Many people object to the cruelty quickly becoming the new normal. They may not speak openly of their distaste, but many of them have connections. Eventually, a plan to sabotage one of the Myohan's  labor camps takes shape. Weapons and explosives are obtained, and a group is formed in secret to infiltrate their way through Myohan's sprawling abandoned cities. However, the Arol have eyes and ears everywhere...<br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 1, if a player is voted by the majority of living players after the minimum deadline has elapsed, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

<br>
<br>
[list][*]All times will be in Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) as applicable, unless otherwise noted.<br>
[*]Each day phase will be 288 hours (12 days), and each night phase will be 48 hours (2 days).<br>
[*]This game uses 12:2 daycount minimum deadlines, and day phases cannot end before the minimum deadline has elapsed. Details on the minimum deadline lengths are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, PM the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<b>1 Town Alignment Cop, 6 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons</b><br>
<br>
Other important setup mechanics:<br>
[list][*]The cop is given a random Night 0 cop check on one of the Vanilla Townies. This result is always green.<br>
[*]Cop results are sane.<br>
[*]Mafia have daychat.<br>

<br>
Hello, [player]!<br>
<br>
You are a <b>Mercenary (Vanilla Townie)</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>You have been recruited by a nameless organization for a mission deep into the sprawling maze-like ruins surrounding Myohan. Your objective is to sabotage one of their five main labor camps, and you've been briefed on how to get there and where to place the explosives. However, you don't know anyone else on the mission; normally, you would decline a risky job like this, but the pay had been 10 Lars, easily 20 times what you usually make. </i><br>
<br>
Your power lies in your observation skills, your voice, and your vote.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>

Hello, [player]!<br>
<br>
You are the <b>Encoder (Town Cop)</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>You have been recruited by a nameless organization for a mission deep into the sprawling maze-like ruins surrounding Myohan. Your objective is to sabotage one of their five main labor camps, and you've been briefed on how to get there and where to place the explosives. You were also given an unnecessarily complicated cypher to learn. You only know how to encode messages and send them by an Upya messenger bird; you don't know how to decode the replies - that was the Decoder's job - and you can't decipher the list of passphrases meant to verify everyone's identity. But now that everyone's said what their passphrase is, you can spend all night encoding one person's passphrase and comparing it to see if it's in the list. </i><br>
<br>
Once each night, you may PM the mods the name of a player. You will check their alignment, finding out whether they are Town or Mafia. You will be informed if your action was blocked. In addition, at the start of the game, you will be given the name of a randomized player who is town.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>

<br>
Hello, [player]!<br>
<br>
You are a <b>Empire Mercenary (Mafia Goon)</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>You and your partners were in a bar when you overheard some mercs boasting drunkenly about a plan to bomb one of the Myohan's slave labor camps. You followed them after they left, and tortured them into giving you the details of the plan before killing them. Two days later, you and two others show up in their place. No one seems to be the wiser, but then one of your partners discovers that you were supposed to have passphrases. He manages to kill the Decoder in time, but is outed and quickly killed by the rest of the party, while the two of you hastily make up bogus passphrases. However, the Encoder is still alive, and will eventually be able to figure it out. Time is ticking...</i><br>
<br>
Your partner is <b>[player] ([role])</b>, and you may discuss with them in <a href="http://bit.ly/MafQT" class="bbcode_url" rel="nofollow">this private forum</a> while you are alive. The two of you will be able to choose a player to kill each night, as well as decide who makes the kill.<br>
<br>
You win when the Mafia are the only ones left, or if nothing can prevent this, so your goal is to stay hidden and kill Town. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>

<br>
<b>The following are standard mafia game rules.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Do not post during the night phase.<br>
[*]Do not talk about this game's events outside of this thread unless you are specifically given permission to do so by the moderators. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Do not talk about other ongoing games in this thread. Referring to anything that has happened in an ongoing game, even if you do not say which game it is, is OOT.<br>
[*]If you are dead, do not post, and do not talk about this game anywhere else. You may still spectate; access to spoiled and unspoiled spectator chats will be offered.<br>
[*]Do not use any formatting that obscures or conceals text. This includes <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[color=#FFFFFF], [color=white], and [color=transparent]</span>.<br>
[*]Do not edit or delete posts, even for typos: what goes in the thread stays in the thread. Instead, use EBWOP or EBWON as appropriate.<br>
[*]Do not quote or pretend to quote any PMs from the mods, including role PMs.<br>
[*]Do not impersonate the mods.<br>
[*]Do not lie to the mods.<br>
[*]Do not abuse loopholes in the rules. Intent will be considered during rule enforcement.<br>
[*]You may use your role PM to ask questions, such as rule clarifications.[/list]</div><br>
<br>
[*]<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Votes and Hangs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><b>This tab covers voting, unvoting, No Hangs, and hangs.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
[list][*]Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.<br>
[*]By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span><br>
[*]Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.<br>
[*]For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.<br>
[*]For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.<br>
[*]Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.<br>
[*]Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.<br>
[*]Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.<br>
[*]Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.<br>
[*]Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.<br>
[*]Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.<br>
[*]The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).<br>
[*]If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.<br>
[*]This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.<br>
[*]If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.<br>
[*]Starting Day 2, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.<br>
[*]Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.<br>
[*]Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.<br>
[*]The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.<br>
[*]Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.[/list]</div><br>

[*]The moderators may extend deadlines at their discretion.<br>
[*]The current deadline can be found in the bottom of the OP (Original Post, or post #1).<br>
[*]If a player with an NA (Night Action) anticipates being unavailable during the night phase, they may submit any night actions to be performed in advance.<br>
[*]If a player with an NA has not submitted their action by 24 hours before the night deadline, a reminder will be sent.<br>
[*]If the moderators do not receive an NA submission from a player by the night deadline, the player will not perform an action that night.<br>
[*]Night results will be sent after the night deadline.<br>
[*]Night will end when the moderators make a post declaring the end of night (EON). You may not post in the thread until then, even if the night deadline has passed. Instead, contact the mods for updates if they miss a deadline.<br>
[*]Players who are temporarily unable to fulfill activity requirements can declare a V/LA (Vacation/Long Absence) by posting the V/LA dates in <b>bold</b> in-thread or in their role PM. Players on a V/LA will not be prodded.<br>
[*]V/LAs should be shorter than one week. For longer absences, contact the moderators for options.<br>
[*]Players who no longer wish to or are unable to play in this game can request replacement by posting <b>Request Replacement</b> in-thread or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Players who have replaced out generally will not be allowed to replace back in.<br>
[*]Players will receive their first PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 48 hours and are not on V/LA. Details on "game-advancing post" are in the Moderation Policies tab.<br>
[*]Players will receive their second PM prod if they have not made a game-advancing post for 72 hours and are not on V/LA.<br>
[*]Players will be replaced if they have not made a game-advancing post for 96 hours and are not on V/LA, unless they post before the moderators find a replacement.<br>
[*]If a player receives 4 PM Prods, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]If a player reaches replacement status more than once, they will be replaced.<br>
[*]Activity Checks (ACs) will be posted periodically. Players may request a new AC in bold or in their role PM.<br>
[*]Activity will reset overnight. Players will not receive prods between twilight and daystart.<br>
[*]If you have access to a private topic, you may request that a partner be poked. The moderators will send a notification via PM to the specified player, but this will not count as an official prod.<br>
[*]If a player is postbanned by the AoPS Sheriff, they will be replaced. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.[list]</div><br>

<br>
In this setup, there are 9 players. Before the game starts, the setup will be randomly chosen from 6 possible role combinations:<br>
[list][*]<b>Setup 1:</b> 1 Town Jailkeeper, 6 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons<br>
[*]<b>Setup 2:</b> 1 Town Cop, 1 Town Doctor, 5 Vanilla Townies, 1 Mafia Roleblocker, 1 Mafia Goon<br>
[*]<b>Setup 3:</b> 1 Town Tracker, 1 1-shot Bulletproof Townie, 5 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons<br>

Other important setup mechanics:<br>
[list][*]This game uses Dawn start. Once all the players confirm by completing the confirm task, Dawn will end, Day 1 will start, and the EOD deadline will be 12 days from then.<br>
[*]Doctors cannot protect themselves two nights in a row.<br>
[*]A Mafia Roleblocker's action takes precedence over a Town Jailkeeper's action.<br>
[*]A Mafia Roleblocker can kill and roleblock on the same night.<br>
[*]Cop results are sane.<br>
[*]Trackers can differentiate between "No movement" and "No result."<br>
[*]Mafia have daychat.<br>

Hello ERROR<br>
<br>
You are Ella (Vanilla Townie)<br>
<br>
Before coming on the train you... that's odd. You can't remember. You've always been here, with your friends, and while you can still feel them here you can't see them anyways. These new people seem nice, but a couple of them remind you of your more unkind friends. But you've survived their bullying &amp; surely you'll live through this. Though you do miss your friends. And there's been weird things going on. Your stuff got moved around. You'll keep them safe at all costs. I would wish you good luck, but it seems your Fate cannot be changed in the same way as the others.<br>
<br>
Your power lies in your observation skills, your voice, and your vote. You may NOT claim your flavor.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello ERROR<br>
<br>
You are Luke (Mafia Goon)<br>
<br>
God. What a bunch of weaklings. Too busy caring for each other to do anything useful. Whatever, more power for you, and after all nobody could do anything better than you. It's only a matter of time before they start disrupting your perfect system though. This train is so slow too, you desperately wish you could be in a car, though you've never been outside of this train. You once told another passenger and they looked annoyed. They're going to get you for that. I mean they're probably rifling through your belongings at this very moment looking for something incriminating. That's it. You have to get everybody who's not on your side off of the train. And you don't care if you leave while doing it because of the better future it will create, which is a good thing too since the omens have not been looking good recently.<br>
<br>
Your partners devised a communication system so that you can talk with your allies at any time. During the night, you also collectively eliminate one other player from the train.<br>
<br>
You win when all Town are killed, or nothing can prevent this outcome.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Jailkeeper<br>
<br>
Whenever any feuds get too intense you always break them up. It deeply pains you to do so, but you've long learned that the best strategy is to isolate one of the parties completely. After many iterations, your friends made a lock that's unbreakable from either side but you're the only one they trust to be able to use it. You've come close to unlocking it early several times, but couldn't bear the thought of breaking everyone's trust.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will both prevent them from taking any actions and stop them from being killed by the mafia night kill.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The 1-Shot BP<br>
<br>
You trust everybody else on the train as much as everyone, but you can't get over the nagging fear that somebody's going to come in to your room and kill you. That's kind of odd, since this is a train, not to mention how close everybody is, but it helps you sleep at night. With a bit of help you made a system that, once it detects somebody's trying to kill you, will raise walls around your bed. But you couldn't ever make it re-usable, but you'd always make another if you needed to. Though in the many years you've been on the train nothing's happened.<br>
<br>
The first time you are targeted by a mafia night kill, you will survive.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Cop<br>
<br>
Whenever you're doing something with your friends you always bring along a book. Not because the conversations are boring but because the books are so interesting. You're mostly on a non-fiction kick these days. As a result you've become the go-to friend not only for any existing knowledge but for finding out anything. Especially about other people. Evil always leaves a paper trail, and you can follow it like no other.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will be informed of their alignment: either Town or Mafia.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Tracker<br>
<br>
You've always been eerily quiet, to the point where if somebody isn't looking at you they won't know you're there. And you've gotten pretty good at hiding yourself too. Whenever the occasional new face joins the train you always watch out to see where they're going. However you do get a little bit too focused and wouldn't even notice if someone punched them in the face, so long as they didn't punch back.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will be informed of who, if anybody, they visit during that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Doctor<br>
<br>
You've wanted absolutely nothing more than to be able to protect your friends, and after several years of hard training you've finally been able to do it. You've been able to help the group get through the occasional rough patch, but you can only hope that you're able to help this new group of passengers. You value nothing more than life itself, and even one more day of life extended is a miracle you could never have expected.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and protect them from the mafia night kill.<br>
<br>
You win when all Mafia are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are The Mafia Roleblocker<br>
<br>
Luke always told you stories of a time when the train was much more quiet, and after that you've always been trying to restore that ideal. You tried just staying in your room, but not only would people keep dragging you out, it was still loud anyways. So then you tried going outside during the night, but someone always eventually went outside. So you tried to mitigate this by copying the blueprints The Jailkeeper uses for his locks, and while that helped, it was still too loud during the day. So you resolved to get everyone who wouldn't be quiet off the train.<br>
<br>
Your partners devised a communication system so that you can talk with your allies at any time. During the night, you also collectively eliminate one other player from the train.<br>
Furthermore, you can target any player and prevent them from taking any actions that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all Town are killed, or nothing can prevent this outcome.</div></div><br>

<br>

<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>Votes must be in this format to be counted: <b>Vote: [player username]</b>.</li>
<li>By default, votes should be made in <span class="bbcode-verbatim">[b] (bold) tags. However, votes made in [code] and [c] tags will also be accepted.</span></li>
<li>Usernames in votes must be spelled, but not necessarily capitalized, correctly. Do not use nicknames.</li>
<li>For the purposes of voting, I (capital i) and l (lowercase L) are considered identical.</li>
<li>For example, both <b>Vote: mathjay</b> and <b>Vote: mAtHjAy</b> are valid votes, but <b>vote: mathjay</b>, <b>Vote: jay</b>, <b>Vote: mathjay.</b>, <b>Vote:mathjay</b>, Vote: <b>mathjay</b>, and <b><i>Vote: mathjay</i></b> are invalid.</li>
<li>Votes followed by extraneous punctuation that is similarly formatted, even with separate tags, are invalid.</li>
<li>Votes in hide, tip, or quote tags do not count.</li>
<li>Vote to hang no one by posting <b>Vote: No Hang</b>.</li>
<li>Unvote by posting <b>Unvote</b>. You do not have to unvote before voting again.</li>
<li>Votecounts will be posted periodically. Players may request a new VC in bold or in their role PM.</li>
<li>Invalid votes will not count under any circumstances. Consider notifying the mods in your role PM if you want to purposely fakevote.</li>
<li>Valid votes will always be counted unless they are clearly unintentional. There is no guarantee that an accidental vote will not be counted.</li>
<li>Votes will be carried over if a player is replaced.</li>
<li>The Not Voting section should be ignored if it contradicts another part of the votecount (VC).</li>
<li>If an error in the votecount is not pointed out within 2 days or by the next EOD, whichever is sooner, the incorrect VC will become official.</li>
<li>This game uses deadline hang: the player with the most votes at the EOD (End of Day) deadline will be hanged.</li>
<li>If two or more players have the same number of votes at the EOD deadline, the player who reached that number of votes first will be hanged. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.</li>
<li>If no votes have been cast by the deadline, no one will be hanged.</li>
<li>Starting Day 2, if a player is voted by the majority of living players, then that player will be hanged immediately; and if No Hang is voted by half of living players, a No Hang will occur.</li>
<li>Upon reaching LYLO (Hang-or-Lose), votes will be locked, meaning that they cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Deadline hang is off at LYLO. If a majority hang is not reached by the deadline, the day will end without a hang, resulting in an automatic win for the mafia team.</li>
<li>The moment the deadline occurs, no further votes will be counted. Details are in the Moderation Policies tab.</li>
<li>If the deadline has passed or a hammer has occurred and the EOD has not been declared, the game will proceed into twilight. Players may still post, but no more votes or unvotes will be counted.</li>
<li>Once the moderators declare the EOD, the person hanged will be officially eliminated and their role revealed. Night will then immediately begin.</li>

This is a semi-open setup.<br>
<br>
In this setup, there are 9 players. Before the game starts, the setup will be randomly chosen from 6 possible role combinations:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li><b>Setup 1:</b> 1 Town Jailkeeper, 6 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons</li>
<li><b>Setup 2:</b> 1 Town Cop, 1 Town Doctor, 5 Vanilla Townies, 1 Mafia Roleblocker, 1 Mafia Goon</li>
<li><b>Setup 3:</b> 1 Town Tracker, 1 1-shot Bulletproof Townie, 5 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons</li>
<li><b>Setup 4/A:</b> 1 Town Jailkeeper, 1 1-shot Bulletproof Townie, 5 Vanilla Townies, 1 Mafia Roleblocker, 1 Mafia Goon</li>
<li><b>Setup 5/B:</b> 1 Town Cop, 6 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons</li>
<li><b>Setup 6/C:</b> 1 Town Doctor, 1 Town Tracker, 5 Vanilla Townies, 2 Mafia Goons</li>
</ul>
Other important setup mechanics:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>This game uses Dawn start. Once all the players confirm by completing the confirm task, Dawn will end, Day 1 will start, and the EOD deadline will be 12 days from then.</li>
<li>Doctors cannot protect themselves two nights in a row.</li>
<li>A Mafia Roleblocker's action takes precedence over a Town Jailkeeper's action.</li>
<li>A Mafia Roleblocker can kill and roleblock on the same night.</li>

<br>
You are Ella (<span style="color:#55d11f">Vanilla Townie</span>)<br>
<br>
Before coming on the train you... that's odd. You can't remember. You've always been here, with your friends, and while you can still feel them here you can't see them anyways. These new people seem nice, but a couple of them remind you of your more unkind friends. But you've survived their bullying &amp; surely you'll live through this. Though you do miss your friends. And there's been weird things going on. Your stuff got moved around. You'll keep them safe at all costs. I would wish you good luck, but it seems your Fate cannot be changed in the same way as the others.<br>
<br>
Your power lies in your observation skills, your voice, and your vote. You may NOT claim your flavor.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia</span> are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello <span style="color:#FF0000">ERROR</span><br>
<br>
You are Luke (<span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia Goon</span>)<br>
<br>
God. What a bunch of weaklings. Too busy caring for each other to do anything useful. Whatever, more power for you, and after all nobody could do anything better than you. It's only a matter of time before they start disrupting your perfect system though. This train is so slow too, you desperately wish you could be in a car, though you've never been outside of this train. You once told another passenger and they looked annoyed. They're going to get you for that. I mean they're probably rifling through your belongings at this very moment looking for something incriminating. That's it. You have to get everybody who's not on your side off of the train. And you don't care if you leave while doing it because of the better future it will create, which is a good thing too since the omens have not been looking good recently.<br>
<br>
Your partners devised a communication system so that you can talk with your allies at any time. During the night, you also collectively eliminate one other player from the train.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#55d11f">Town</span> are killed, or nothing can prevent this outcome.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are <span style="color:#55d11f">The Jailkeeper</span><br>
<br>
Whenever any feuds get too intense you always break them up. It deeply pains you to do so, but you've long learned that the best strategy is to isolate one of the parties completely. After many iterations, your friends made a lock that's unbreakable from either side but you're the only one they trust to be able to use it. You've come close to unlocking it early several times, but couldn't bear the thought of breaking everyone's trust.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will both prevent them from taking any actions and stop them from being killed by the mafia night kill.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia</span> are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are <span style="color:#55d11f">The 1-Shot BP</span><br>
<br>
You trust everybody else on the train as much as everyone, but you can't get over the nagging fear that somebody's going to come in to your room and kill you. That's kind of odd, since this is a train, not to mention how close everybody is, but it helps you sleep at night. With a bit of help you made a system that, once it detects somebody's trying to kill you, will raise walls around your bed. But you couldn't ever make it re-usable, but you'd always make another if you needed to. Though in the many years you've been on the train nothing's happened.<br>
<br>
The first time you are targeted by a mafia night kill, you will survive.<br>
<br>

Hello, you are <span style="color:#55d11f">The Cop</span><br>
<br>
Whenever you're doing something with your friends you always bring along a book. Not because the conversations are boring but because the books are so interesting. You're mostly on a non-fiction kick these days. As a result you've become the go-to friend not only for any existing knowledge but for finding out anything. Especially about other people. Evil always leaves a paper trail, and you can follow it like no other.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will be informed of their alignment: either <span style="color:#55d11f">Town</span> or <span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia</span>.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia</span> are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are <span style="color:#55d11f">The Tracker</span><br>
<br>
You've always been eerily quiet, to the point where if somebody isn't looking at you they won't know you're there. And you've gotten pretty good at hiding yourself too. Whenever the occasional new face joins the train you always watch out to see where they're going. However you do get a little bit too focused and wouldn't even notice if someone punched them in the face, so long as they didn't punch back.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and will be informed of who, if anybody, they visit during that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia</span> are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are <span style="color:#55d11f">The Doctor</span><br>
<br>
You've wanted absolutely nothing more than to be able to protect your friends, and after several years of hard training you've finally been able to do it. You've been able to help the group get through the occasional rough patch, but you can only hope that you're able to help this new group of passengers. You value nothing more than life itself, and even one more day of life extended is a miracle you could never have expected.<br>
<br>
Each night you can target any player and protect them from the mafia night kill.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#FF0000">Mafia</span> are killed, so your goal is to find them. Play towards your win condition, and good luck.<br>
<br>
Hello, you are <span style="color:#FF0000">The Mafia Roleblocker</span><br>
<br>
Luke always told you stories of a time when the train was much more quiet, and after that you've always been trying to restore that ideal. You tried just staying in your room, but not only would people keep dragging you out, it was still loud anyways. So then you tried going outside during the night, but someone always eventually went outside. So you tried to mitigate this by copying the blueprints The Jailkeeper uses for his locks, and while that helped, it was still too loud during the day. So you resolved to get everyone who wouldn't be quiet off the train.<br>
<br>
Your partners devised a communication system so that you can talk with your allies at any time. During the night, you also collectively eliminate one other player from the train.<br>
Furthermore, you can target any player and prevent them from taking any actions that night.<br>
<br>
You win when all <span style="color:#55d11f">Town</span> are killed, or nothing can prevent this outcome.</div></div><br>

what the yellow child meant by "trust"<br>

we will lie by omission but we won't say untrue things about how the game works, what the right choice to make in a specific situation is, whether you should claim etc<br>

<div class="bbcode_quote_body">I also think a point in favor of mathjay being town is that he doesn't seem paired with many people this game.

oh no<br>
shari is like a lvl1 scumread, like surface level<br>
like, initially their posts were super disconnected from the thread and like just floating and commenting on random things<br>
but at some point she started joining wagons<br>
like, if someone posted a case, like the initial wagon on mathisgod, shari would be like the first or second person to be like<br>
oh yeah that sounds right and vote them too<br>
right place, right time, watching the thread, but lowkey agenda'd<br>
like, they're doing the right motions but they're not actually going through the thought processes needed to do those motions, and the thought processes that town do to do those motions<br>

i articulated it but<br>
it's like a very basic scumread<br>

I don't particularly want to be the guy who hammers or puts someone at L-1<br>
And I've generally found Rueger to be scummier than sid<br>
so like<br>
<b>Vote: Ruegerbyrd</b></div>
</div>
<br>
oh dont do that<br>
mechanically we just let them live and let them resolve through night actions<br>
if scum thinks they're pr, then they're going to use n1 kill on them anwyays<br>
if rug really is pr, then its good that we didnt hang them<br>
if rug isn't pr but scum still kill them n1, thats good cuz real pr gets extra night extra life<br>

the initial wagoning is def something to consider on shari's alignment it's kinda a newbish thing to do but still it's solid for a lvl1 scumread anyways</div>
</div>
shari actually doesnt have that many plausible pairings to me<br>
its mostly just rug/mathgood and the way that they hopped between those wagons<br>
<br>
if both rug/mathgood are town, shari wolf equity goes up<br>

I mean it's not just that but I feel like he's just been generally really towny throughout d1<br>
Idk the way he entered the wagon doesn't seem partnered to me, like "not entirely confident to wagoning but who cares Skippy could be right" is a weird thing to say when entering your scumbuddy's wagon (if he wanted to bus wouldn't he try to get more credit from it maybe?)</div>
</div>
<br>
i follow the scum logic of it a lot.<br>
like, in that threadpos with pressure on mathgood dissipating, i dont know if k12 knows whether hes able to save shari<br>
especially because all three of us had basically coaled on shari by then<br>
like yes if it was us, its either saveable or bussable but k12 doesnt know that and i think it makes sense from the perspective of trying not to be caught up in shari interactions<br>
u kno<br>
the newbie logic of "ur defending xxx u must be scum partners"</div>

i dont meld with it<br>
<br>
1. thread dynamics<br>
k12 really, really, really fell off.<br>
i'm choosing to read it as them having difficulty making reads but not with any other aspect of the game. Did he even hard commit to the mathgood wagon? because<br>
<br>
2. sid/rug vanity push<br>
he seeded reads with rug specifically and only rug from way way early on, from the post where he linked like 5 different rug games and was like, "if rug posts the same as that 3p game she's probably scum" which i took to mean rug had no scumgames on record and now in hindsight, implies hindsight bias or agenda. like, it should be "rug does/does not sound similar to her town games" but it wasn't even that.<br>
<br>
and then while thread was pushing lhf k12 pushed sid/rug wolfteam out of nowhere with interactions. idt he mentioned sring them individually, i certainly dont remember him sring sid out of context of that w/w. sorta looks like busywork cuz i don't remember k12 really saying much about mathgood/shari at all.<br>
<br>
3. eod<br>
if w!k12 then they were paralyzed at eid because if he hard pushes mathgood, then because shari/mg cws then he looks like he's defending shari. at the same time, he can't push shari because he's hoping we'll just change our minds without him having to do something himself. so i think the rug/sid thing is just entirely for towncred specifically because he feels so disconnected from eod until the end.<br>
<br>
idk i can read again, but i think it was pretty clear that shari was going over instead of mg by the time k12 said "well fine ill sheep"</div>
